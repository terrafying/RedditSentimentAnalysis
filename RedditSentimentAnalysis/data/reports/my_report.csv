With the recent backlash against CMC after the Binance sale, Coingecko has the opportunity to be the main aggregating site, but the longer the page 1 rankings are manipulated to hide popular projects, I believe the more likely alternative aggregators will gain market share.

I appreciate running such a site is not straightforward, and projects try and manipulate their position with various nefarious tactics. However, one project in particular has a large, passionate community, and a finished product that is genuinely innovative, instead of the usual fork+false ""innovation"" tactics projects which Coingecko et al list on page 1. Continuing to hide this project from page 1 is a horrible mistake, and the longer it's not listed the more angry Coingecko users will be when they find out what they have missed out on. 

It's also been one of the best performing projects price wise of 2020, but people that use Coingecko for discovering projects have missed out on the gains. Why? Because Coingecko refuse to list the circulating supply, even though its an erc20 and is listed correctly by other aggregators like Coinpaprika and Nomics. 

Like I said I know running an aggregator site is not easy, but in this case Coingecko is clearly making a horrible mistake. Please reconsider your decision."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The first was a [partnership with the Jeju Island government](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-jeju-island-selects-120000674.html?utm_campaign=ICON%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), Korea’s #1 tourist destination, to track and monitor COVID-19 cases. Jeju Island welcomes over **15 million tourists annually** and every visitor will be required download the Zzeung app for certification and verification purposes. And last week, the team announced the [first commercialized blockchain based KYC credential with Shinhan Bank](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/iconloop-shinhan-bank-launch-first-120000252.html?utm_campaign=ICON%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), one of the largest banks in Korea. This digital ID will allow users to seamlessly open accounts across financial institutions with one MyID login.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are monumental achievements not only for our ecosystem (because they **both use our public network $ICX**) and the blockchain industry, but also the identity market in Korea as a whole. This is mass adoption. But it’s really just the start.  
&gt;  
&gt;**There will be more announcements so stay tuned!**  
&gt;  
&gt;The ICONLOOP + Shinhan’s Digital ID is now the most CREDIBLE digital ID in Korea. And with two other banks (NH and IBK) launching soon very soon, Zzeung will gain traction as the country’s leading digital ID aggregator platform.

**How does this use ICX?**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**How will the Zzeung app work for Shinhan Bank?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Users are required to download the Zzeung mobile app and verify their identity using a Korean telecom service. At this point, a verifiable credential is issued via ICON’s public network [$ICX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ICX&amp;src=cashtag_click&amp;utm_campaign=ICON%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) similar to Jeju Island use-case.  
&gt;  
&gt;Next, users select ‘Shinhan Bank KYC Authentication’, and then a Zzeung KYC compliance certificate is issued and stored on their mobile phones once Shinhan Bank verifies the users’ identity.  
&gt;  
&gt;When submitting to other organizations, a special case for the regulation of innovative financial services is applied so that the user can resubmit after verifying the fingerprint without repeating the previous identity verification procedure.  
&gt;  
&gt;A private blockchain network is used to verify any forgery of identity information.  
&gt;  
&gt;When visitors arrive on Jeju Island, they will download a mobile app (Zzeung) to checkin into tourist destinations using a QR code. The data will be secured on blockchain and only accessed in the case of a COVID-19 contact.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before you ask (From me, not the article):**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Yes these utilize ICX. Keep in mind that every partnership has ICX in mind. Yes this uses the public blockchain. Yes it gives whales and retail investors a reason to buy ICX. Why? Well... do you want to chase ICOs, DeFi, and YFI on the promise that they ***might*** go up off an a case that doesn't exist, or would you rather invest in something that actually delivered on its promises and is being adopted by an entire country (with more to come) **and** being used today? Your call.
2. I got burned by buying ICX at $10 dollars at the peak of a bull market, it keeps going down, and it's not pumping, so it's useless coin right? Read above and below.
3. Stop worrying about people buying the ICX on an exchange. That alone doesn't make its price go up, its the actual use case that does. If you're looking for fast gains, there are risky plays such as Uniswap and YFI. It doesn't matter whether you're concerned about people buying it or not. It's going to go up regardless because the thing is actual used and not a false promise. This is kind of the ""secret sauce"" if you will.
4. If you have the largest banks in South Korea and the government federally approving a **public** blockchain for the use of people through all of SK, you've already won half the battle on mass adoption. An analogy would be the equivalent to the USA mandating the use of something like this to verify every transaction."

The dungeons drop blockchain items that you are able to use or sell on the enjin marketplace and since the game is still in early access there’s actually a pretty good chance to drop some high rarity items that are worth a decent amount of money.

1. It took this long for Cardano as creating scalability is hard...and it looks like after all these years Eth is still a long way of scalable smart contracts solution. For Cardano they’ll have it by the end of the year. Eth won’t be ready until at least the latter half of 2021

2. Cardano has a got a great community and is going to be the first smart contract solution to also be scalable (actually I don’t know enough about cosmos in this regards)

3. Cardano offers a great opportunity for those that get their defi products on there early. Having a defi product on a scalable platform rather than through and intermediary such as polkadot simplifies future upgrades 

4. At the very least devs should be learning more about Cardano in the next few months ande deciding for themselves if they need to have one foot in that camp just in case"

If it looks like a pump and dump, get ready to exit more aggressively. If it's a long hodl like BTC, start with a smaller % and weight it more towards an ideal price (it may not reach it any time soon, but it also probably won't dump).

Just some rough numbers to demonstrate the relation:

**Coin A** (potential pump 'n dump):

* Current Price $10
* Expected peak at $20-$22
 * Sell 50% @ $18
 * Sell  33% @ $22
 * Sell 17% @ $25 (and sell off @ any price if it dumps)

**Coin B** (long-term hodl w/ oscillations):
 
* Current Price $1000
* Expected near-term peak at $1750
* Expected long-term peak at $3000+
 * Take 10% @ $1500
 * Take 20% @ $1750
 * Take 30% @ $1900
 * Then buyback when the price drops, and keep minimum 40% for long-term goals. If you aren't going to buyback then reduce percentages.

I think a few factors to help you decide should be: Expected performance, volatility, whether or not there are predictable oscillations. Decide how much you're going to hodl if any (based on long-term expectation), then break down the %s in respect to the risk so that you aren't over-exposed (don't want to get caught on the dump).

One exception though, is that if BTC/ETH jump and the whole market follows, you may need to raise the sell prices on less stable altcoins because the growth isn't necessarily related to the altcoin performance (it could pump from a higher baseline).

I'm happy for an critiques on that strategy, btw. I mostly just hodl tbh."

&gt; “The reality is that the first-mover advantage is actually a disadvantage. Those network effects were ephemeral and often covered with mistakes and scars and explosions. You actually want to be in the imitator, the second-mover category for DeFi. And I think we'll have a lot, lot more luck than the first-movers did in the space.” One of the reasons for this lies in the fact that the first-mover architectures and designs were “just too inflexible” while Cardano is “much better suited as a platform,” Hoskinson added.  “That’s what 2021 is going to be about. There’s gonna be a lot of that fighting, a lot of that pushing. We’re in it to win it, guys,” he summarized.

Charles Hoskinson is planning on beating everybody with a project that has no development community, no user base, which uses a programming language that nobody uses on a platform that doesn't have smart contracts more than 5 years after the ICO was started in January 2015."

I don't know what the word for it would even be... not really DCA'ing since it's based on hitting specific targets, not selling at time increments.

How would you determine what percentages you take out at which price points? Is it pretty much arbitrary / personal preference or is there a proven strategy?

How do you balance locking in profits, vs taking so much off the table that you regret it if the coin continues to explode upwards?

Say if you bought BTC today for $11.5k and your goal is for it to hit 60k. Would you start taking some profit once it's gone up 25%? 50%?

Personally I think I want to wait until any given coin that I own is 50% of the way to its expected target. Then remove just enough to cover the initial cost I've invested to remove any risk, and hodl the rest."

Most what you mention are a bit strange. The ASIC for RandomX mining algo is the best CPU in existence. Such CPUs are usually available in closest computer store all over the world.  Botnets can mine Monero or can do some other very bad things elsewhere. So mining Monero sounds quite good use of them. They secure network well. But sadly not that many mine it.  

Bugs can happen to any coin. Inflation bug in Bitcoin was abused once, in Monero was not. Only way for such bugs not to happen is to audit all code. Monero does that and spends vast amounts of money that is collected by random donators for auditing all code that researchers do.  

Updates happens only when you have something to update. In first 6 years was plenty. Sooner or latter that will reduce to very rare or to none at all.  The consensus or the Boss is that updates makes transactions smaller and faster or ledger more opaque.  Of course only when code of such updates is audited by several companies.  If triptych will show it is in Monero consensus or Monero Boss spirit then will be added to Monero protocol in 2021 or 2022.  If not will be just research that some other coins or something else can use.  

Monero will be labelled as a criminal coin only if people will label it. Currently on darkmarkets many more people use Bitcoin. So on this chart Bitcoin should be marked as a crime coin. But that is silly. Same as to call USD a criminal money or shoes a criminal footwear is silly."

Have a small intro section and a menu at the top for things like ""about"" and stuff like that. When I am digging around a site, I usually look for who/what kind of information and how to get in touch.

I also noticed that when I click on an item (say Ethereum) the price/volume section does not populate initially. It is empty. When I click on ""past month"" or ""past year"" it populates and the graphs start working. I am on Win/Chrome.

I would make the donate link more prominent (a button perhaps)?

Bitcoin is gen 1- it’s obvious as to why. Though some would say it started with hash cash, ecash, digicash or bitgold. 

Ethereum is more or less generation 2- smart contracts and dapps and the beginning of DeFi. 

Gen 3 is mostly a buzzword for PoS, scalability solutions and cross chain compatibility and DeFi progression. Eth 2.0, Cardano, Cosmos and NEO3 for example. 

Third generation blockchain is the hype and I’ve certainly fallen for it myself. To me it’s innovation and thinking about the future rather than relying on results from the past. It’s a focus on changing how blockchain is utilized and it’s certainly becoming more decentralized. Feel free to argue against this wherever you see fit."

YFI

YFI is the token for yearn. There are only 30,000 issued. So, you can not earn them, you can:

1.	⁠Stake them for governance rewards
2.	⁠place in a yYFI vault to gain more FYI
3.	⁠Use them as long term Venture Capital funds within a DAO (coming soon).


Yearn

Yearn is a group of smart farmer protocols that allow pooling to reduce gas costs and benefit from smart developers / contracts.

The simplest EARN take tokens / stable coins and place them in the highest yielding platform for that token. https://yearn.finance/earn

The yCRV vault provides USD stable coin liquidity within curve for trading fees, but also lending fees via Yearn pools for each stable coin (oh and it gets CRV governance tokens…).

Other vaults use more complex strategies. For example, see this video on the Link Vault (Mark Jeffrey 13 mins).

https://twitter.com/markjeffrey/status/1300175793352445952

I expect the ETH vault may be similar, but may include Maker to generate the stable coins (rather than borrowing on Aave).

All of these steps can be done by yourself, however, gas costs would be significant."

It seems you have no idea what you're talking about, again.

When using credit cards, you give the other party PERMISSION to charge you whatever they want, ANYTIME, and they have your info FOREVER.
With Bitcoin on the other hand, it's a ""PUSH"" transaction, YOU decide how much and when to send it.
If you use a 3rd party that deals with your funds he will be holding the funds for a month before transferring them to the merchant(like with credit cards) and you will be paying fees for that.

Bitcoin already scales to layer-2 with the Lightning Network which allows instant and unfairly cheap transaction, you should read about it, or even better, try it yourself.(It takes under 60 seconds to pay and load a gift card to Amazon).

And according to you, there are ~300,000 daily fraudulent transaction on Bitcoin. Seriously, where did you get that number?

Please stop talking nonsense and do some research."

“This is because, unlike other lightweight wallets, Electrum decided to not have only few harcoded servers that will be responsible for the privacy of all users, and act as single point of failure, but instead allow users to run their own servers or use servers that they trust. Electrum takes user privacy very seriously, which is why proper peer to peer discovery without central authority arbitration was adopted, instead of anything else. This way an attacker cannot keep an Electrum user offline, or isolate him, or pull various attacks.”"

You got refunded because that's a 3rd party holding the funds for you and you are paying fees for that.
And if you don't call them on time for a fraudulent transaction (30-45 days usually) they will probably will deny your claim.

Every time you use the card you are giving the merchant the ability to charge you the amount he wants, he can do whatever he wants with that info later on.

Depending on how much you want to invest, if you plan on starting with hundreds of dollars, just stick to one or two coins.

My mistakes:

I was looking at my portfolio every minute, moving one coin to another that I believed would go up tomorrow and then sell at a small profit or loss when I panicked. Just put 70% of your portfolio in stable coins that grow in value every year and have strong bull runs. Don't touch them, don't check on them, just forget you even bought them for a couple of years. (obviously if you want to buy on monthly basis don't forget them)

So don't touch your main investment no matter what.

Don't keep jumping from one coin to another, especially not with a couple of hundred of dollars, the chances of you paying exchange fees matching what you earned are not worth the effort, i have finally decided not to touch my entire portfolio and in the last day it went up several percentages without me running around and checking every second.

Now, about the 25-30%, I suggest you invest in some alt coins and a small amount for something that is fresh or even going to be listed but you believe in their vision (for instance I put around 7% in DOT, I kinda believe it will catch on and gain traction)

So, to sum up what I learned as a noob who wants to hold mostly, and until I get the hang of it:

* Invest most of your portfolio in your choice of the top 10-15 coins, as others said, if you have a thousand dollars, don't buy in 10 different coins, buy 2 or 3. If you plan on putting thousands then invest in 4-6.
* Don't exchange coins every day, hold, until you get the hang of it and know what you are doing. 
* Don't panic and keep looking at the coins every second, they are like waves, they will go up and down, but eventually in 2, 3, 5 years you will see a good investment done. 
* Invest a smaller portion of your portfolio in newer tokens and coins, they might flop or reach the moon, expect either, and if you can't afford it, just buy more stable coins. 

I am new as well, i can tell you what i invested in but I suggest you do your own research, and ask more experienced people.

35% Ethereum / 25% bitcoin / 20% litecoin / 10% xrp / 7% dot / 3% bat

I had invested in a dozen other coins until I realized my mistakes and decided to consolidate everything and just throw my wallet away and check on it every now and then, i mostly check reddit in case of catastrophic news and I need to act, and not the histograms."

I also have crohns since 20 years so I know a bit about that. I ""gambled"" a bit in the HYIPs back in the days so I recognise what that is and what type of persons who ran the programs and how that worked. That combined with the whole story is in my opinion enough to make me sure that he is alive.

He must have made great money already from the exchange and probably previous scams. My guess is that it's a thrill to pull off a big scam. Planing and executing the whole thing must have been quite a lot of work and for a scammer a super ego boost to manage to be declared dead while getting away with the money. A Scammer success story worthy of a holly wood robbery movie.

I think he will resurface eventually but that could take a long time, at least before the new version of him is connected to the old version.

That is my opinion."

* Buy Bitcoin
* Devote a portion of your funds, 10-20% of your portfolio to moonshots like $0xMR, $BZRX, $MTA
* Stake $BZRX and $MTA (if these platforms do as well as I think they will you will be able to live off of your monthly staking rewards).
* Sell a portion of your funds when you have 10x and invest it in new moonshots you have researched

How do you change BTC into Ethereum tokens? You need to register on exchanges that have a fiat onramp (this will allow you to cash out when you are ready). Send your BTC to one of those exchanges and trade for ETH. Withdraw your ETH to a metamask account you set up (save your password and seed words somewhere safe and do not share them with anyone). Buy the projects you like on Uniswap (wait for gas to go below 100gwei on Ethgasstation. 

If you want to make it you need to find and invest in projects that haven't mooned yet. There are a lot of scams on Uniswap now so be careful."

1000% this.  I only wish that these exchanges would make HW-2FA mandatory or put some nasty message at every login saying ""Your account is insecure... Get thee a Yubikey"".

One bone I do have to pick with Binance is that they don't support dual HW-2FA.  This is fine for something like Trezor / Ledger where your HW-2FA can be cloned if lost.  But allowing ***ONLY-ONE*** yubikey on an account is bad policy.  They should require redundant HW-2FA in case one fob is lost.

As much as everyone hates Coinbase, this is one thing they got right.  They allow dual HW-2FA and they support Yubikey, Trezor and Ledger U2F.

Usually for 2FA you have some RNG that generates e.g. 6 digit numbers. Only two systems in the world are aware of the seed, your generator and the validator in the wallet. So the attackers could not know it.

BUT the attackers don't have to know it. They just have to make it look like they do. 2FA is not present in Bitcoin itself, but only in the wallet. If I was the attacker, I would just make any input to the 2FA system return a positive result. The only thing they need from OP is to sign the transaction with his private key.

In other words, 2FA is only safe if you can trust the wallet."

To be fair, there are legitimate arguments to be made depending on what one sees as desirable. Bitcoin really does have an advantage in terms of resources, network size, and recognition. True fungibility, while desirable in principle for many reasons, does create regulatory issues that may prevent mainstream adoption. Neither Bitcoin nor Monero is great as a pure payment rail. And most of the ongoing growth in DLT is in non-currency use-cases. So it's not as simple as saying ""Monero is better"", since any such statements need to be qualified by a definition of what purpose you're considering them in relation to.

Essence mandates a stronger P2P Bitcoin/Monero economy in tandem with DEXs. Industry pretends to agree, but you can tell who's side they're on by what they comply with. 

DEXs have fortunately improved a lot over the past few years. Here's a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8FraG0Hb2A) of XMR being converted to LN BTC on XMR.to, and BTC being sent via Lightning to a non-custodial Stakenet DEX wallet where it is then swapped into LTC without trace.

Side note, I know the XMR community and even devs have expressed interest in adopting Lightning in some way and I'm very eager to see that happen down the road. If XMR becomes Lightning swappable, then the entire LN and ERC ecosystems will be able to benefit from its immediate obfuscation."

One advantage of crypto is that it \_is\_ possible to start this small.  The other thing is that the sector is so risky and volatile that it makes sense to start with very small investments to get comfortable with the process and dollar cost average with more money and generally ending up with a lower average cost than throwing in a lump sum.

March's downturn was a tiny taste of that stopped by massive intervention.  Martin Weiss of the hardass independent rating service put out this book in the Great Recession:

 [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Ultimate+Depression+Survival+Guide%3A+Protect+Your+Savings%2C+Boost+Your+Income%2C+and+Grow+Wealthy+Even+in+the+Worst+of+Times-p-9780470486139](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Ultimate+Depression+Survival+Guide%3A+Protect+Your+Savings%2C+Boost+Your+Income%2C+and+Grow+Wealthy+Even+in+the+Worst+of+Times-p-9780470486139) 

He talks about how his father at the start of the Great Depression saw long term Treasuries go down even though the theory was that they should go up.  This was the immediate rush for cash. 

So the important thing is to try to make your personal circumstances secure enough to not have to sell in the panic and even better, to be able to buy after the downturns.  The markets did go up and down over the course of the 1930s.  

Crypto, being a global market, might get support that the US stock market couldn't get back then as people the world over will be looking for a safe haven, but it will probably be even more volatile than over the time it has existed so far."

&gt; is crypto still worth it?

Popular opinion seems to be that we're about to enter a bull market. If you just buy bitcoin today and hold for a year, there's a good chance you'll double your money or more. Personally I've been out of it for about 3 years and just getting back in right now because it looks very promising

&gt;Which one? 

Look on https://coinmarketcap.com/ , research coins in the top 30 or so, and pick a few that you like or sound promising.

BTC/ETH are probably your safest bets. Then you get into stuff like Chainlink or Cardano that are more risky, but a higher chance of 10x-ing your investment. The lower down the list you go, generally the more risky it gets. Past the top 100 coins you're basically gambling or buying penny stocks. Arguably way higher up the list than that even.

&gt; What's the initial investment needed? 

As little as like $10 I guess? To start with, you probably want 0 - 5% of your current savings in crypto. It's still a risky speculative asset.

To me, the idea of putting $10 or even $100 into crypto doesn't really seem worth it. You put $10 into a coin and it increases in value 10x... cool, now you have $100, is that really significant to you? 

Personally I try to find the sweet spot between where if I lost all the money I invested, I wouldn't really miss it or lose sleep over it. But still enough that it would be a sizeable chunk of money for me if it went up 5x or 10x.

&gt; What about it being stolen?

From most to least safe: Buy a hardware wallet or create a paper wallet and put it in a safe or safety deposit box, create a wallet on your computer or phone and make sure the device is password-protected ideally with 2FA, leave on a reputable exchange.

If you follow basic safety and don't do anything too dumb, the risk of getting scammed or having your crypto stolen is quite low."

Both have been on a downward path since Dan and B1 decided broken governance was just fine, high performance was 26 TPS average and transaction cost wasn't a network emergency at such insane levels that it made ethereum look much more efficient and cheap.

The largest fundamental issues of EOS IO have yet to be addressed and I think you've put a lot of hope into the Telos project fixing these massive short comings. Not to mention no ground breaking network features are coming from Block.one. I too would be burned out. It would be easy to feel like everything is one big pile of shit.

This is coming from someone who put resources and a lot of time into building scatter connected governance tools that were intended to help users better engage with EOS governance. I also did my best to help push and advocate 1Vote to the community. It became clear that my resources were better spent elsewhere when the most influential entity of every EOS IO network, Block.one, wasn't stepping up. In reality, they have been part of the problem at best.

As much as everything brought up was one steamy pile of shit, there are other projects in this industry that do have good direction, self awareness, great technology and ideas that have incredible potential.

Many instances of people that have been verified for years and suddenly get locked out of their account.

This is why those people have gone to Twitter to publicly slander bittrex which often leads to a response. This alone is unacceptable. I myself have never experienced issues but it drove me away from them.people have also started to file claims with  official authorities as it seems to be the only way to get them to do something.

I am wayyyyyymore petrified of losing keys than getting scammed or stolen. Today is much better than even several years ago, but its almost a sure bet that anyone in the game long enough has lost some crypto at some point in time to HDD fall, corruption or simple forgetfulness.

No way to say exactly how many keys are lost forever, but I am very confident that number is significantly higher than keys/crypto stolen.

It has survived more cycles than any other alt.

It's on all the exchanges.

Faster than BTC.

Has its own halving cycle one year before BTC's that led to a run in the last 2019 halving.

Cons:  Short on development, developers, and funding.

Probably less room for growth: compare the price on the historical snapshot to today's price.

Its ATH in the $300s was during the 2017-18 parabolic run, but it was the cheapest of the big three: BTC, ETH, and LTC on offer to noobs at coinbase.  Now there are a lot of cheaper choices.  A lot of commentators are expecting a big run if everything goes up, but plan to take profits thinking that it might not do as well in future cycles.

Companies that grow (apple, tesla, amazon, ETH) become more valuable as they acquire new positive aspects such as de fi.  Tesla started out as a car company and is now much more than just a car company.  Amazon started out selling only books and has now expanded to sell pretty much anything.  

Growth of a strong solid crypto is a natural phenomena of the market like happened to the stocks I mentioned above.  We established that growth is health for the price you only need to ask yourself, does gold grow and acquire new value?  Yes but at much much slower paces...  And only shines in times of great crisis..  Supposedly.  It does buy only very slowly and only in cataclysmic times.  

I'm not a prepper.  I don't store food in the basement cause the zombie apocalypse will happen...  I don't' cackle with glee hoping the dollar collapses to .20 so I can say I told you so and have a 1MM BTC in a couple of years...  ""Muh scarcity"" arguments pales in comparison to what ETH has built; will be built much in much the same vein as Amazon, Apple, Tesla have bypassed the price point of gold as it was a hedge to inflation and dire market crashes...  BTC doesn't innovate; will not scale so you have to ask yourself, do I want 20,000 in profit because the echo chamber manage by Pomp and Winkelvoss Twins or do you want to invest 20,000 in a company that is increasing in value because of organic growth and network effects, both properties of ETH?

That's true. I wouldn't suggest this for a very small amount of money below 1000 BTC or so.

OpenBazaar is a multisig escrow application, not an exchange. In addition to the escrow being independent of the payment network, they don't have full control over the coins.

As a matter of fact, we are currently in an equity valuation bubble, ""smart money"" is exiting as retail investors are loading up bags. Older main street folks, without access to privileged information are the ones looking for security and certainty.

That's not what's happening at all. Rich people like certainty, that's why they like bonds-it's guaranteed risk-free money. The problem is that bond yields crashed, interest rates are 0, and inflation fears are high. Bond money is just flowing into the stock market. Nothing more, nothing less."

Anyone can operate such a public server and some users will be randomly connected to it.

A recap of the issue thanks to Ben K.

When broadcasting a transaction on Electrum, it gets sent to the Electrum Server you are connected to for propagation to the network. The server should try to add the transaction to its mempool and further propagate it to other Bitcoin nodes.

In case the transaction is invalid, the Electrum Server the user is connected to can return an error message, which will be displayed an error popup on the user's Electrum client.

Prior to Electrum v3.3.3, the error message returned was allowed to be free text, so the Electrum Server could return any message it wants and make it pop up on the user's client as an error message.

Now the attackers here exploited this free-text capability, along with the fact that anyone can run an Electrum server to which clients will be automatically connected.

The attackers then have set up a public Electrum Server, which was tweaked so that instead of propagating the user's transaction as it should, it always returns a malicious error message directing the Electrum clients to a phishing website to ""upgrade"" their Electrum version.

So when users of Electrum got randomly connected to such a malicious server, they were given the malicious error message directing to the malware download site. Since it looks just like any valid error message within the app, it was easier for the attackers to fool the users. 

This did not affect users who were only connected to their own Electrum Server, since the problem is the error returned from an untrusted server. It is always best to use your own node, and when using Electrum, run and connect directly to your self-operated Electrum Server. 

 This also did not affect users who properly validate their downloaded software and its download source, as well as users who do not store coins on a hot wallet (and properly verify addresses on the HWW device). 

 As a note, this summary is based only on my own understanding of the issue, so there might be mistakes, which if you see please comment on."

You can also use something like KuCoin and simply not do the KYC, assuming you're happy staying under the daily withdrawal limit.

There are a bazillion articles out there on 'top 10 DeFi projects you've never heard of' type stuff, which are useful for research, so long as you take everything with several grains of salt and DYOR after. There are also places like r/CryptoMoonShots, which, again, has a lot of shilling and shadiness, but can be useful as a way of finding out about random stuff as a starting point for research.

Another angle is to look for projects that mooned hard in 2017/18 and have since fallen out of favour, but are still developing. Many of these projects have been forgotten about but are actually closer to delivering something real than some of the new ones. As an example, OMG was under a buck for a long time, and went up to $9.50 last week before settling above $5. That's an example of a really well-known project that was still kind of neglected by the market (and it's already had a good pump so I wouldn't jump on it right now), but it's an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about. There are similar kinds of things out there in the 100s and 200s in the rankings that would be worth looking into."

I am only allowed into the club if unanimously voted in by the other primary obelisks. This  isn't even as decentralized as EOS. In EOS you could at least delegate your consensus voting to someone you chose. This model doesn't even allow that. It's nothing more than a distributed permissioned database, which the world has piles of already.  

Trustless consensus is a hard problem, which is why current systems are slow. Of course it's easy to make a fast system if you do away with the hardest requirement of crypto! This system has no advantages over EOS, which is already a steaming pile."

Then, take your printed private key and cut each individual number and letter out into a separate micro-sized piece of paper. Hide each individual piece in some remote location: for example, put one piece of your paper private key behind a brick at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, put another in a hidden spot in the Statue of Liberty, etc. To help you remember where you put the individual pieces of your private key, make up a riddle for each location that only you (and perhaps Nicolas Cage) can solve.

If you find a super low cap gem it might be on other exchanges but that's a pretty big red flag in general. It's hard to point you in the right direction without shilling anything in particular. I really like coinbureau on YouTube. He does a good job of giving basic overviews for altcoins, but I wouldn't pay too much attention to his top X coin videos etc. Obviously just because he does a video on an alt doesn't mean it's a gem, but he does a good job of filtering the obvious shit coins.

The best way to learn is to start researching from there. Learn about the ""eth killer"" blockchains like cardano, Tron, neo because they have better tech (for now) but less adoption. Learn about POW and POS coins, maybe some of the eth tokens that are really popular right now (beware scams). Diversify around classes of projects you think will be interesting or useful. Obviously you know BTC and it's usecase, so maybe checkout privacy coins (monero, dash, etc), smart contract coins (mentioned above), super scalable coins (ripple, nano, grin). 

From there you will probably see a lot of other coins mentioned so don't be afraid to check them out. In general stick to top 100 coins because after that it gets really sketchy. The most important thing is that a coin fulfills an actual need in the world. Many of the coins in the top 20 even are solutions looking for problems, or are redundant and questionably valued."

Ethereum(ETH)- ETH 2.0 phase 0(binary for phase 1)is due soon with it being in the Medalla testnet now(the final testnet). Big plans and big dreams with this project. Obviously as my username suggests I am biased to this one.

Ripple(XRP)- I’m a known “hater” of this one but I’ll still list it for unbiased research purposes. Ripple is the company and XRP is the token for the platform. Ripple have made a lot of partnership announcements with international banks. Cross border banking seems to be a focus for them. 

Stellar(XLM)- some of the XRP team moved over to start XLM after some disagreements at development level. Stellar seems to be more focused on the merchant and consumer side of banking. XLM and XRP can have a harmonious future together. 

Cardano(ADA)- Shelley is live. Shelley is the PoS system that means it is fully decentralized relying on staking nodes to run the network. There are over 1000 already. Goguen is due Q4 2020 which will enable smart contract development. 

NEO/GAS- Gas is the token for the NEO network. A big focus for NEO right now is NEO3 which will open up the DeFi market and allow easier dapp development. A very developer friendly platform(java, c#, python instead of a custom language). NEO is also really committed to cross chain compatibility. They want NEO to talk to other blockchains. 

Ontology(ONT/ONG)- another OnChain project(originally developed on NEO) ONT are focused on blockchain ID and enterprise adoption of it. ONG is the gas token for the network fees. In the ideal future economic world NEO and ONT will work with many other chains to provide services. Neither of them wants to be a “killer” but rather mergers. 

Icon(ICX)- Also working on ID and enterprise level adoption. Recently announced a deal with banks in Korea to provide their service. It’s been a quiet project but is starting to make some noise. 

That’s a little list to start some thinking. Do not invest in them based on this little detail. I’m not here shilling my coins. I just like to share options of projects I follow and research myself. I don’t hold all of these in my wallet but I respect them for tech, vision, ideas and concepts."

Nope, total fee volume is a good thing, because that pays miners to increase the security of the chain, especially as the block subsidy disappears. Its individual fees being higher than they need to be thats a bad thing. You want that total fee volume spread over as many transactions as possible. With Ethereum's higher transaction throughput, it has the ability to collect more fees at a reasonable level, and will therefore eventually become a more secure chain than bitcoin.

&gt;Right now bitcoin transactions are as high as 2017 bull run and the fees amongst their lowest ever recorded.

&gt;This proves the congestion issue was an implementation problem (exchanges not batching transactions), and not a design issue (1mb blocks).

Firstly, the main reason fees havent exploded like last time is because the increase in demand has been gradual. Bitcoin is still not capable of handling mass adoption spikes like we saw in late 2017. Secondly, coins like ethereum are acting as a pressure release valve for bitcoin fees as it eats its lunch. Thirdly, implementation was obviously going to take time, and segwit was never going to be adopted quickly if it was 'opt-in'. That you people thought it would shows you have no idea how businesses work. The core devs have proven their economic incompetence many times now. ""We dont expect fees to ever exceed $1."" LOL

&gt;Bcash has failed. We warned you. You lost all your valuable bitcoin, digital gold, for fools gold.

Oh really? Good thing I diversified into a basket of many bitcoin alternatives throughout the scaling debate when I saw that your camp is a lost cause. Also, for tax reasons, I still own more bitcoin than you might think. Dont worry, I'll dump on you slowly over time as ethereum continues to eat your lunch ;)."

Vitalek solf, Brad G sold, David S sold, architects sold, play the runs, but the hype, thr movement, it but a shell of what it was.

The hold get rich mentality with the free poof money of crypto has had its day.

It also had some crazy security fails and had to roll back the chain. It lost far more marketshare than BTC when it was all said and done. The trust was lost and it has been losing marketshare to BTC ever since.

Moving to proof of stake is not in Bitcoins realm of possibility at this point. Some see this as a weakness while many other see it as it’s strength. The digital world needs an unchanged anchor to the real world, and something unchanged in a fast paced always changing space is actually also needed. This is where Bitcoin seems to fit and the ecosystem can grow around its rules rather than changing to adapt the participants change to accept. The point is everyone plays by the same rules and not one individual, or country can change it. 

Re 51% attack: it is the main possible attack vector towards bitcoin at this point. But it is so unlikely because the costs would far outweigh the benefits and it may not even be physically possible at this point to procure all the ASIC miners needed to carry one out. 51% attack is taking over 51% of the network mining, and replacing spends and possibly even ledger history. The problem with a 51% attack is it needs to be continuous, it’s not like a flip of the switch where all of a sudden if you have old consensus on a network it stays that way. Google Andreas Antonopolous 51% attack, and there’s a good video of him walking through the mechanics of how it would work and how unlikely it is for it to stick. Also a more recent article here details a few of the attack vectors that exist in Bitcoin and the likelihood of one being successful. 


https://decrypt.co/29625/the-biggest-threats-to-bitcoin-in-2020

Remember too, that an attack on Bitcoin is temporary. There is nothing to stop the devs from forking a new code to stop the current attack, and the network participants to follow along a new Bitcoin that has not been tainted by poisoning from a state level actor. The mere threat of a possibility of a fork also adds to a the successful defense of a theoretical attack."

This is a common refrain I keep seeing from people who don't understand the economics at play. What the Fed does is capitalize banks balance sheets. It doesn't directly create Inflation. For inflationary expansion you need commercial banks to lend. The Fed has capitalized banks to fucking pluto an back while also removing the reserve required to 0%. Guess what they still aren't lending. [The majority of the stimulus is here untouched] (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) 

The Fed is frantically trying to increase the monetary base by credit expansion. Which is the same play they've been making for 40 years. [The exponential increase in the monetary base] (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2) 
The problem is its not working anymore. In the 80's the Fed was able to jack the Fed funds rate to 20%, lowering lending standards for credit and forcing commercial banks to lend to survive. They can't do that anymore. If we were getting inflation it would show up in the [M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) 

Only reason we got a bump in Inflation was from the pause of debt and direct stimulus to people. The Fed is trying to avoid another deflationary contraction  like 2008 of dollar scarcity which actually made USD more valuable not less. This would cause crypto l, metals and equities to tank."

There’s a reason Coinbase is getting traction. It’s simple to understand and convert fiat, and they’ve done an excellent job dumbing the space down to a mainstream level of understanding. Mobile currency needed a Paypal to normalize the space. The same needs to happen for crypto. Once the foundational understanding is there, folks will start to branch back out into more sophisticated uses/layers with increasing complexity, just like retail investors do in traditional markets. 

Hopefully the internet bubble analogy is true, and we’re in the first shrink before the big mainstream explosion. Will help me feel like I wasn’t late to the space :)"

When you want to send to Address A - you paste it in, and the wallet asks your HW to sign a transaction to address B. If you don't check this your screwed. 

Likewise it can generate fake receive addresses ( without contacting the HW ) - which is why after you generate a recieve address you need to click show on HW. The trezor web app won't let you see the address untill you do this. Obviously a malicious app will not have this restriction.

But how many people will not notice this.

People need to learn how to use HW properly otherwise it  might not help.  There needs to be some training i don't know, like a video to show what it looks like to interact with a malicious wallet connected to a HW."

Total fees is a good thing, it provides financial incentives to maintain the network (BTC/ETH fees incentivize mining, Uniswap fees incentivize liquidity providing).

Of course, high transaction fees are a bad thing for users. But we're going to start seeing more layer-2 solutions squeezing more transactions into the same block space.

For example: a single token transfer on Ethereum costs around $2 these days. That same $2 transaction could contain data for an optimistic/ZK rollup that contains tens of thousands of token transfers.

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

I understand that you hope that your investment performs well. Hoping that innocent, good people have a bad time, lose their homes and life savings is far beyond hoping for a good year in crypto.

Sometimes I have the impression, that some people here wish for a post apocalyptic word, where those who bought a certain asset first, rule the world, without contributing to the productivity whatsoever. People will never accept this. This is NOT adoption.

Your best bet is to give people a good reason to use crypto besides speculation, so it grows and everyone can profit from it in some way.

If a transaction has a cost (the fee in this case), then the user *does* have incentive to appraise the value of the transaction. The cost of mining a block increases with its size, so an infinite capacity does not imply free transactions and a miner has an economic incentive to limit the size of their block.

Were still pulling that shit out of the ground everyday. Bitcoin will eventually have no more coming, with a limited supply. You let a few companies hold those few, then there's no value because it can't be integrated into the economy. If cant be widely accepted if it isn't widely held by many people. Grayscale isn't likely to hold all or most of bitcoin, but the fewer that hold bitcoin (or any other asset for that matter) the less demand there is from a grand scheme. Especially with that asset isnt used for anything other than a store of value. Gold people will always wear and turn into a consumer product. Oil is essential for many products in everyday life. Bitcoin isnt used outside of a store of value and the less people that own it, the less it will be used for that. Just like if 1 person owned all the gold, the value of that gold would be essentially nothing. No one would make jewelry out of, no one would use it to store value, no one would use it because there wouldn't be access to it. Bitcoin is essentially the same concept. And if a couple whales own all of it, then it will crash in value and take all the demand with it.

And i still don't see Grayscale allowing its customers to redeem their shares for actual bitcoin, meaning they just hold a piece of paper backed by the trust that Grayscale and Bitcoin will be worth something. When that value isn't there, those shares will be worthless."

As much as the stock market lives on hopes and dreams of future profits, the crypto space is even more delusional. 

At least with a stock, you're holding some percentage of something that has value. Some business that does something and receives money for that. 

Crypto has no intrinsic value, other than its scarcity (other than a few projects where a token has a fixed exchange rate with a currency or service).

So by brining BTC into an ETF, I think Grayscale is helping to legitimize it. Just like a gold ETF helps liquidity in the gold market, USO helps liquidity in oil markets, etc. It allows people who can't (or don't want to) physically receive the asset to still trade on its value. 

Remember how hard it was to sell a car, or a bike or something before eBay, Craigslist, and other listing services popped up? You were pretty much limited to people you knew, or people who walked by your yard sale, or you sold it to a dealer for way under value. 

Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs are like the eBay that expands the market exponentially. Which in turn means the price of the goods more closely follows it's real value.

So if Bitcoin really is worth $500k-$1mil when it is fully integrated into the economy, then that happens much faster with the likes of Grayscale."

**Please be careful about what information you share and the actions you take.** Do not share the amounts of your portfolios (why not just share %s?). Do not share your private keys or wallet seed. Use strong, non-SMS 2FA if possible. Beware of scammers and be smart. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose, and do not fall for pyramid schemes, promises of unrealistic returns (get-rich-quick schemes), and other common scams. Be safe out there &lt;3

Likewise, Bitcoin is much more portable than gold, but that portability, and indeed Bitcoin's very existence, depends on functioning internet and network infrastructure, neither of which is guaranteed to survive, say, a globally apocalyptic event the way gold would.

It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search). 

Thank you to OtherAMPBot for this information and detection code.

But, re: the Quadriga, it was never a 'good' exchange in the sense that it was always basically a Ponzi scheme, with a lot of shady doings being covered up by a combination of new deposits and steadily-rising prices through until 2018. Cotten didn't so much start becoming shady suddenly in 2018, as have a system that had been shady to some degree all along suddenly become unsustainable and come crashing down. It came as a surprise from the outside, but if he'd been regulated and audited, the issues would have been evident way earlier.

Something like Coinbase, which is regulated and audited, is a cut above that standard, and there are more such exchanges now than there used to be. Not to say that they can't still fail, but the odds of them failing under such 'unexpected' circumstances are low. 

All of which is just to say that OP should feel no fear in using a reputable, regulated exchange, certainly for short periods of time and even, assuming it's not crazy $$, for longer terms. People often get tied up in the principle of 'not your keys, not your coins', but the reality is that there are enough risks associated with self-storage (usually related to being an idiot with your info/security in some way) that it's not a black-and-white issue for most people."

- Token usage is directly related to client wallets. Token used for the 'transaction' on the blockchain being the validation. This creates the hash that is related to the document being validated. Also makes them GDPR compliant.- Buybacks every month (also etherscan txi'ds for these on the dashboard). 10% of the 20% tokens burned from validations are bought back. TXid's for these also on the VIDT dashboard.
- A partner of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition (government backed, other partners include ING, IBM, PWC, CMS) - https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/coalitionpartners
- Incoming Q3 news expected regarding hardware client + other news
- Top in volume on Kucoin for a while now behind BTC &amp; ETH (not on binance yet)
- All dutch team. Offices in the UK &amp; Netherlands. Address on website
- Subsidiary of an existing document security company established in the Netherlands
- Check datalink on their medium (using existing blockchains to validate data - maintains speed + efficiency) - https://medium.com/@pim_vee/vidt-datalink-limitless-compatibility-between-businesses-and-blockchains-c04e926ee73d
- Clients only pay for service in fiat, no meddling with the token at source for them. Token is used for validations, then a percentage of tokens used for this are burned every month.
- The amount of VIDT used for validations is dynamic. Clients will always pay the same price in fiat. Token divisible to 8 decimal places 
- Company has been in the black since November 2019

If you're going to cash out your entire stack it's fine to put it all on the exchange at once. You don't have to do it in small $100 increments. Although if you are paranoid, you could do it in $2k increments if you want, just don't waste time doing $100 at a time for $10k.

The big thing to do is to research the exchange you are going to use before you fund your account. Check forums to make sure they aren't having problems with people withdrawing money. Make sure they have reasonable fees. But watch out if their prices are TOO good. Scam exchanges will offer great prices to sell your bitcoin, and people will use them without researching because it looks like such a great deal.

And just because an exchange was legit 1 year ago doesn't mean they are ok to use today. So even if you used them previously, check up on them again before sending money. Quadriga was a legit exchange for a long time, but then over a few months they slowly stopped paying out withdrawals until they stopped completely and stole everyone's money."

To convert your BTC, you'll need to have it on an exchange.  So at some point, you'll be using an exchange.  Regardless of what others (including myself) say with respect to not keeping funds on an exchange, it is inevitable that you'll have them on-exchange for a short time at least.

By using some of the most reputable exchanges, you'll minimize your risks.  Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and other big names should see the lowest risk of losing funds, and the less time that you have assets on the exchange, the less risk you face.

Having said that, for a lot of newer or less experienced users, there is an appreciable risk in transferring assets from an exchange to a wallet.  A lot of people make mistakes.  So if you're talking about small amounts, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't feel safe leaving some funds on an exchange, especially if it is one of the more reputable ones."

By that I mean that your biggest risk vectors are either 1) you do something stupid with your recovery seed, the risk of which is higher the more wallets, and therefore seeds, you have; or 2) someone sees you or connects your online identify to your real one and threatens you/your family with something unpleasant if you don't disclose your info, in which case multisig doesn't really help you (unless you use dummy accounts, but [you can do that with a single wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-Passphrase-options) anyway).

The real strength of multisig comes in situations where no single entity owns the assets in question--like an exchange wallet or a 'team' wallet shared among people for some other reason--and you don't want any single person being able to unilaterally do anything without the others' consent. When the assets are wholly owned by only one person, as seems to be the case here, the benefits of multisig become more 'niche', and the downsides begin to factor larger. For example, even if you aren't concerned about the above, [there are still downsides to multisig](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/the-pitfalls-of-multisig-when-using-hardware-wallets-9b0e98e4c19c) that should be considered.

Personally, I think the most secure option for most users is a SINGLE hardware wallet, or a paper wallet if you don't need regular access. In either case, store the parts of the recovery seed in several, geographical separate places, and you're very, very safe. I think the potential benefits of multi-wallet and multi-sig options are balanced out by the increased risks in other areas, to say nothing of the additional costs and pain-in-the-ass of setting it all up and using it. However, if, despite all that, it still makes you feel better, there are resources out there (e.g., [here](https://medium.com/@tiero/how-to-bitcoin-multi-signature-wallet-using-electrum-and-several-ledger-nano-s-225867e3b726) and [here](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multisig.html)) for how to set this up."

But imagine if there were a form of digital gold that could be used as a trusted store of value and could be easily transported across borders and exchanged between anyone with internet and a smartphone. Wouldn't that be great? Of course, that kind of trust takes a long time to build up. Bitcoin is still a baby compared to gold in that regard, but that baby is growing up, and more and more people are waking up to its potential. I'm not saying that Bitcoin (or whatever other cryptocurrency someone may prefer) doesn't have its own limitations, because everything does, Bitcoin included. Currently, it's very volatile and yes, largely speculative.

Often when people first hear about cryptocurrency (usually Bitcoin initially as it's the most well known) they'll say: 

'What's the point of that? I can make payments easier using my bank, or Google pay, or Paypal!' 

My response would be that if you're living in a developed country with a stable currency and your government is not completely corrupt, you're *probably* fine with traditional banking. Not everyone is that lucky though. And who knows if you or me are always going to be that lucky? Bitcoin was created to take control of financial power away from banks and governments and put that power in the hands of the people. As long as you have a smartphone and internet connection, you're able to send and receive it, anywhere in the world! Hopefully in years to come more regular people, and especially the millions of unbanked, will become aware of this and be able to make use of this. It truly is revolutionary. Of course with that comes great personal responsibility. You're being your own bank here, so keep the keys to your crypto secure.

You sound like your mind is made up, but here is a documentary explaining what exactly 'money' is and why Bitcoin is so important, for anyone who is interested:

So, my recommendation:

One ledger with a passphrase.

One Trezor with a passphrase.

I like the idea of doing multisig with two different companies, you never know. Store them in different places, Start with a small amount when the multisig wallet is created, then pour it all in. rehearse the passphrases every now and then.

When all that is done, consider a Yubikey. unrelated but is a powerful security tool."

Kraken is a registered company in the US. Their ownership and address is known.
Regarding Kucoin, things are more than shady. Address, ownership, ... there are only some vague hints. Maybe everything is legit but maybe they are suddenly gone one day.

Also be careful with the many coins and tokens on Kucoin. No other exchange in crypto space lists but also delists coins faster and more often than Kucoin. So it can happen that the coin you bought today, is delisted tomorrow, and rapidly loses value.

I would also be very careful with comments from Kucoin. Not really trustworthy. For example, users constantly ask for a dust converter, and Kucoin always comes with the same stupid reply that it's in the works, wait for the announcement. They pull this shit for years. Of course nothing happens"

Most of the stuff nowadays you need to have assets first to stake and lock up, or mine smaller coins but that will eat into your electricity. Even in BTC early days it wasn’t super profitable if you kept selling what you mined, the real riches came from holding a few years."

What was missing was synthetic assets (i.e., options, futures, or swaps), a reliable stablecoin (which will now be built off a basket of cryptocurrencies), and automated market makers (i.e., uniswap).

Through interoperability protocols (i.e., [the recently launched Poly Network](https://neonewstoday.com/general/neo-collaborates-with-switcheo-and-ontology-to-launch-poly-network-a-new-tokenless-and-heterogeneous-interoperability-protocol/)), users will be able to stake NEO, GAS, NEP-5 assets, ONT, ETH, and BTC to be able to earn FLM, which will be Neo's DeFi token.

As a majority of the development is being done in-house, there'll be a phased roll out of various components that will encompass the DeFi platform for the Neo ecosystem."

The founder is the ex CEO of Sergey Nazarov's company. In my view, their oracle pool architecture is superior to Chainlink's for a few reasons, I'll paste some comparisons below that I typed up previously. They are also constructing a DEX and will have a stablecoin. The price hike is due to several things. Acknowledgement by IOHK/Cardano, rumors of direct integration into the upcoming Cardano wallet, launch of their oracle pool core, and the lack of liquidity. ERG did not have a pre-mine, as it is a POW chain. Therefore, the supply is fairly well distributed, and the devs do not control 65% as in the case of LINK. The mining emission rate is low, and it's currently only listed on some very crap exchanges, so there is very little to go around. 

Disclaimer, I am invested as of a few days ago. I hold zero Cardano

https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/oracles/Oracle-Pools.md

**Comparison notes**

Chainlink vs. Ergo:
Similarly, epochs provide a perfect way to implement disincentives, such as stake slashing (oracles joining a pool have to put up collateral to join). ChainLink aggregators do not have this at all currently (with only promises that it will be implemented), and their design makes it more challenging to encode them. Oracle pools are designed specifically to improve the assurance of oracle data, thus incentives and disincentives fit in perfectly. We have already started to write informal specifications (and contracts soon) making them a palpable reality rather than just an idea in someone’s head. (Also all stake is in the blockchain’s native currency, rather than a custom token like LINK)

An oracle’s job inside of a pool is to source and guarantee that external data is posted onto the blockchain in timely manner. This is a job that has actual value, and makes 3rd parties who aren’t the source of the data actual valuable participants. This is a consequence of the epoch design of oracle pools which doesn’t exist in ChainLink. Thus for datafeeds, ChainLink oracles are effectively useless middlemen that simply take a cut, which in Oracle Pools the oracles themselves are performing the equivalent of a timely delivery service.

Thanks to extended UTXO, Ergo can construct arbitrarily large oracle datapoint hierarchies of confidence easily which make it possible to have pools of pools (continuing to higher tiers as well) and thereby scale accuracy upwards at the cost of price/speed. This isn’t possible with ChainkLink’s design, because oracles are inherently sole actors, and there is no design for aggregating aggregators, and having that scale. Furthermore, the lack of the UTXO model prevents such hierarchies from working well at all. The accumulation of data upwards through the hierarchy and the dispersal of funds from the top downwards are both an order of magnitude more complex to perform (and likely more prone to bugs/errors), which translates to higher costs and making it an open question whether it is viable at all on an account-based model.

Oracle pools have multiple approaches for incorporating governance (ChainLink has none). Furthermore oracle pool governance is very flexible and has a stronger impact than ChainLink’s passive reputation system. This means that oracle pools can use internal governance where individual oracles (who all have a game theoretic incentive to act well in order to earn money) vote on parameters/the list of oracles, or an external governance DAO which distributes the responsibility to a large number of DAO members can be used too. Due to the longevity of oracle pools, an external reputation system isn’t required, but instead direct action can be taken through the governance mechanism to immediately improve the quality of data and remove bad actors. This direct approach provides immediate effects which has a much greater impact for the end-user (furthermore a reputation system can still additionally be built on top if so desired, where if any oracle is kicked out of one pool their global reputation decreases)."

That was before the economy was cut in half. They won't say the big d word deflation. Which is the most likely scenario. 40 years of expansive monetary policy and inflation has led us here. More debt credit expansion isn't going to cure the problem. They are just crossing their fingers an hoping we don't get a deflationary contraction but after 10 years of QE without shit to show for it and the economic crisis worse than 2008 its going to happen. They want to avoid 2008 dollar scarcity and liquidity crisis but turning on the printer at this point isn't going to do a whole lot.

The majority of what the Fed does is capitalize banks balance sheets. This doesn't immediately give us inflation it just saves the banks. They have to lend for us to get inflation. If you look at the M2 velocity we aren't getting inflation.

We are getting it from the pause of most debt since covid which stopped normal dollar destruction when debts are paid back. Also from direct stimulus to people.

1. The YAM contract was written in a week with no code audit. It was a meme experiment and the creator was explicit about that. People knew the risks going in. The assets placed in that contract are actually safe, it was just the governance token distribution that was bugged, and those YAMs were primarily earned not purchased. So very few people actually lost money even there. 

2. Yes even audited and battle tested contracts can have bugs. There are potential risks with governance token centralization, admin key abuse, flash loan tricks, etc. But these risks are similar to the risks you face putting your money into a Greyscale stock. What if their building burns down? What if regulators shut them down? What if an accountant runs off with the crypto they hold? What if they get phished?

Truth is I'd rather trust an open source and audited contract on a decentralized network than a centralized physical private company any day. You use Vitalik as an example of why someone shouldn't use DeFi but he built Ethereum specifically to be used in ways like this, he's just saying that you should use your brain not follow a meme.

3. Using a fiat currency is setting yourself up for a loss."
2020-08-30 00:09:34+00:00,[0.31162903 0.01020062 0.6781704 ],neutral,0.3014284,"My opinion (tldr: bullish) regarding bitcoin price action in near future, written in answer to a question in /r/bitcoinbeginners:

I started buying btc in 2016, and have been holding only btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years.

Shared again for people who haven't read it."

Never implied you did. Only that if there's intrinsic value in a Bitcoin you'll have to prove it to me. If the price of bitcoin is zero, what use does it have ? The answer to that question defines intrinsic value.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; is proof to it’s adoption. 

No it's not. You can't really look at 10 years of existence of a currency and say that it has been adopted. You have to look how it performs over very long periods of time and how it performs during recessions and crisis.

The ""adoption"" everyone here is talking about is a myth. Most of the capital in Bitcoin is hyped up little investors that convinced themselves that ""hodling"" is a good investment strategy while that money in precious metals would have had massive returns in the last 2 years.

Mainstream adoption too is a myth. Massive money printing has given fuck you money to hedge funds. And them allocating 0.01% of their assets to bitcoin doesn't mean there's adoptions. It only means money is cheap and they can inflate bubbles everywhere.

Also if you take crypto as a whole. While there is scarcity of coins in their respective protocols. There's no shortage of new coins. How is that different to just printing new bitcoins ? You buy a newly developed coin with bitcoin you dilute the value of bitcoin while the market cap stays the same."

The biggest problem as always is human greed. Seeing your anonymous crypto buddy doing x100 with shitcoin in a month tells your brain that you can do it too. It seems like you are a fool as you are one of the few people who are just holding while people who do not even now what mcap are making ridiculous gains. But the truth is that 99% of your crypto buddies will probably lose everything chasing other moon coins. Once that happens most of them will naturally start hating the whole crypto space and start calling quality project scams as they are left with useless bags.

Yes, many new features and improvements to existing features.

&gt;I don't see there being ""protocol improvements"" to improve speed, that has not been the focus.

The protocol improvements have been about making the transactions smaller, by optimizing the cryptography. For example, old RingCT transactions where around 13kB, but this has dropped to 2.5kB since 2018, and a further 25% decrease will be implemented this fall. This is obviously good for scaling, because it keeps blocks smaller. Concerning speed, there have been optimizations of the verification time of transactions, which lower computation requirements. So it has definitely be a focus of much research.  
Private transactions will always take up more space than public transactions though, that is a fact, but very much worth it. IMO a cryptocurrency cannot function as a true money replacement without privacy.  


&gt; Most people do not live in the first world or have access to high speed internet. 

To be fair, cryptocurrency cannot exist outside the internet. A stable internet connection is absolutely required. Even in the developing world, 3G and 4G mobile broadband is very common, and is already more than fast enough.

&gt;when everyone has fiber optic speed internet 

Fiber optic speed is IMO along the lines of 1000/1000 down/up Mb/s, a mile away from current average DSL or cable or indeed 3G/4G speeds which are already more than sufficient."

You don't understand intrinsic value. Gold, even at 0 dollars, has value. It has material properties that no other metal can emulate.

That is intrinsic value.

While there is value in the payment system, Bitcoins in itself has no intrinsic value.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  almost all of the properties that makes gold a valuable asset is built into bitcoin and improved upon.  

Except adoption and offline use. And historical evidence of bitcoin being a inflation resistant asset.

TELOS basically is what EOS should've been, it's based on EOS chain (so it's a clone sort of) but the things that stank at EOS were changed (BP voting, governance) and the good things stayed (fast/feeless structure). TELOS actually has amazing decentralized governance (DAO), something ADA is working on through Voltaire, something that Tezos achieved but in certain ways, not as great as TELOS. 

APPIC also joined TELOS network, and a few others. The zoochain only has increased in activity and will continue to do so. Also TELOS has a cool lending protocol, with a unified pool wich exchanges can integrate. You can then lend your TELOS to this pool to Increase liquidity AND receive compensation for it (12-16% APR currently, will fall to less if more people add liquidity). This is a VERY cool concept since it's possible to have a single liquidity pool over several exchanges which would bring stability to it's liquidity. Currently I believe newdex uses this system from TELOS (not 100% sure here). 

Getting TELOS might be the hardest part though. It's either newdex (EOS dex) or Probit (bit of a D to C grade exchange, it's an exchange you do business in small amount, get your coins and GTFO - it has been my way of gaining TELOS but I've now got the amount I wanted so I'll be waiting, sitting on the coins and get that 12-16%)."

1. Newbie account makes a post about new exciting coin (for simplicity the ticker will be SHIT) that has just been launched on Uniswap (that newbie is either a team member or gets payed by the team to shill the project)
2. Other newbie accounts praise the shit out of SHIT saying it is revolutionary and is the new defi platform of the future. Don't believe them? Just ask the anonymous dev on telegram and he will confirm that SHIT is the future. Also, you can check the price chart and see that SHIT has already made 5x so it has to be super duper
3. Greedy degenerate gamblers, who are not satisfied with 10x or 100x returns that legit projects offer over the course of several years, FOMO in and additionally raise the price and start praising SHIT themselves
4. Price has now risen already 10x in a couple of days and new greedy degenerate gamblers FOMO and repeat step number 3 
5. This can go on for a while until a bug is exploited as most of these platforms are not audited or until the early pumpers/team decide that the price has reached the ceiling and dump SHIT on greedy degenerate gamblers
6. Greedy degenerate gamblers start crying cause they invested all their savings in an unaudited two day old platform lunched by anonymous dev on telegram

Sure, you can make money on these shitcoins same as you could on [this beauty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCcwn6bGUtU&amp;t=133s) back in 2017 which reached a mcap of 2.5 billion at one time.

I personally wouldn't touch AMB.  If you want to speculate,  VET, UBT and TRAC are the holy trinity of  on the logistics/IoT/tokenised assets space. Between those 3 projects AMB just doesn't stand a fighting chance. A portfolio consisting of VET UBT TRAC is a fairly solid bet for speculating on the logistics-data industry (which will be fucking huge within the next few years imo)."

We also have old school coins like Monero and ZEC offering true privacy. 

But the true power comes from decentralised finance, imagine the government giving you a credit score whilst they print TRILLIONS and are creating a HUGE debt bubble. Sorry but that's absurd. Give me a collateralized ratio I can monitor and safely use for smaller loans any day of the week.

The legacy centralised financial systems are clunky, out dated and costly, all of this reduces useability towards us, the customers.

DeFi and the new fintech solutions change the narrative, with no old school real estate costs, large staffing costs and profits for share holders, crypto DeFi users can earn good % rates on their savings.

This isn't an ETH shill, DeFi is everywhere now, DOT, TRX, ONT, XTZ, NEO, WAVES, SOL, and so many others are ALL offering these amazing services.

So yes, ok, blockchain is a public ledger, but pseudo-privacy and pseudo-annonimity is still there and the scary dystopia you are referring to is suggesting mass control, whereas, in reality, DeFi and decentralisation of non-sovereign money will only serve to erode their stranglehold!"

If we were to extrapolate from only these two ‘isolated’ incidents of liquidity injections, we can expect that in 2040 the Dow Jones will be at 100k, and the average home price in America will be north of 550k.

However, I don’t think these are isolated incidents, and therefore the change in the delta of inflation is itself increasing, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Dow at 200k, and an average home price of 1m by then.

And that’s barring any other economic disaster.

lol this thread is just another coordinated hit job on Ren and this comment is the proof. Might want to at least get your facts straight. Keep launched tbtc and it died from a security vulnerability 2 days later. They rushed to beat Ren to market and failed. Fusion is a scam run by DJ Qian and everyone considers their security flop an insider job (by him no less surprise surprise). Wan is a joke that was hyped in 2017 with ICX and AION and turns out to be the ugliest sister of the three. All three projects have literally done nothing worthwhile except get hacked and fail.

Meanwhile, REN chugs on and the people that really matter are adopting it at increased pace. So congrats on your fud as all it has done is increase Renvm use. Up to almost 12k BTC locked now :) The market has spoken!"

This age of boomers will most likely not be involved in crypto other than conversations. I often have to show her how to work the remote control for things like when she gets a PIP and can't figure out how to undo it. 

It is just going to be one of those generational things that has to happen before the majority of masses are completely involved in it. From B/W TV to color to internet and cell phones, older people have a learning curve to keep up while youngsters learn it early and stay immersed in it. I swore I would never not keep up with technology but I was very foolish to think so.

 While I was very smart, top of class, etc. I find that just as my Mother said, ""Just wait 'till you get older!"" (in reference to doing silly things like misplacing keys or can't turn on a phone) it is now coming to pass. I somehow turned on silent mode on my phone without realizing I did it and wondering why I was getting no messages from people telling me they were sending them. I put my car keys in the refrigerator and was late for work. I used to hear people talk about their ""blackberry device"" which I had no idea what it was. It wasn't until no one used them anymore that I learned what it was. I am falling behind. 

While I've managed to figure out how to create wallets and buy/sell, it took some researching and investigating but it was something I was interested in. If you are not interested in it, no amount of effort is going to put you down that path. In 2016, co-workers started telling me about BTC and I laughed at them, called them silly for wanting to invest ""real world money"" into ""fake internet digital money"". They were buying, I was laughing. I finally began to listen to their conversations, I started reading and investigating. It began to become more common to talk about BTC with them so much so that I began buying a little to test the waters. I began reading about ETH as it was touted as being the next BTC so I figured I'd make that my BTC since I had lost out on years of low prices (BTC was $845 at that time) and ETH was just $10 so that began my journey and in that short time it has all changed so much. It will continue to grow, evolve and become more simple and the next generation will see full adoption."

Now I’m really not encouraging anyone to buy it as I hate the get rich quick crowd plus I’m waiting for a buy order to go through so stay away. But I’m just amazed at how people don’t research things and just throw money around on random coins. Even if you hate Cardano, seriously just make sure you stay informed about it. And no, I’m not gonna make your lazy ass life easier by telling you all the reasons I’m super bullish on this coin. DYOR."

**Why use Digibyte's DigiAsset?**

The chain is active for last 8 years so it there for a very long time to prove that it is not some new hype project.

Digibyte's transaction fees are extremely cheap, and this utxo chain can handle the load of transactions from reddit community.

It takes 15 seconds between each blocktime, and the block size is capable of handling 1066 TPS and growing with time, as chan gets old till the last coin is mined.

Some things that you can do with digiasset tokens

**Fees**: Determines if there should be a fee when an Asset is transferred and what address should receive the fee, there could be multiple fee rules for one asset. One can think of this rule as facilitating Asset Affiliation.

If the Reddit community wants that a token is essential for voting but also want to keep the assets limited so they can set a fee that needs to be paid in the token the asset maker set, it can be the asset itself or some other token, so every time token is transfered the set address will recieve fee. This can help fund the community.

**Expiration**: Determines the lifespan of an Asset. When expiration time is reached the asset returns to the last valid Output with a valid expiration.

Lets say the community has decided to run give access to some special content for a time being, then asset expiration can be set after which they won't be able to use the asset to login or show that they have access to that content.

**Minter**: Addresses that are allowed to re-Issue an Asset, regardless of the [asset type](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/DigiAssets-Protocol-Specifications/wiki/Benefits#coherent-issuance-policy).

So, if there are 4-5 mods who should have the capability to minting new assets you can allow them by adding their address to the asset and allowing them.

Read this comment to dispel the myth of energy consumption 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ihws5t/daily_discussion_august_28_2020_gmt0/g36yec5/

So now that you see its not about the amount of energy consumed but the price of energy consumed to secure a PoW coin that is important. To answer this is simple. Hashrate tends to follow price , thus the total cost of employees, security , rent, ASICs, and electricity will tend to follow the price of Bitcoin as a rough estimate. Thus if Bitcoin is trading at 20k USD a coin(lets assume 1 BTC in tx fees per block) you are looking at ~20,000x(6.25+1)=145k x144(blocks a day) = 20.9 million of cost in PoW effort(not energy alone). Since the largest cost is electricity we can than calculate 20.9m x ~0.75 = ~15.7 million in electricity used worldwide to secure Bitcoin for 1 day 

IMHO this is a very efficient and small price to pay to secure a global currency"

It's just a interbank messaging system that requires 2 warm bodies. Even Gpi isn't an improvement. Swift will never have settlement in 4 seconds without a counterparty (correspondant banks).

I find it ironic that Ripple an xrp get the banker coin moniker. When the largest banks in the world like the top 6 don't want Ripplenet or Fednow to be a thing. They've spent billions lobbying against Ripple/open networks and are trying to create closed digital payment networks. 

Swift is the old way of interbank FX where if you can imagine the market as an inverted pyramid the top  correspondent banks control international finance by offering liquidity as service because they hold all the foreign exchange reserves.

Ripplenet is leader in the fintech banking industry. Ripplenet democratize's the entire process of interbank FX markets and decentralizes liquidity. Eventually you'll be able to do International trade as a small business or bank without the costs of traditional international fx transactions.

They were doing 50% of Santander Group's (17th largest bank) fx transactions in 2018. Verified out of the mouth of their chief executive. She also said that if they could theyd have all their business utilizing xrp. Unfortunate reality is it will take time to build out liquidity. They have way more demand than the system is ready for. They just hired Goldman Sachs former head of global fx to build out liquidity and bring on market makers. 

You say there is no connection to xrp but I find it a leap of logic to assume that the most valuable company in the crypto industry has no plans for its native token. All while their busy building the base of global payments network that has the potential to be one of the most valuable companies in the world."

My question is, do I have to transfer it back into my Coinbase account to now sell it for fiat?

If Coinbase doesn't support it then you wouldn't be able to use Coinbase to sell it for fiat. If an exchange doesn't support directly trading fiat with Kleros, then you would need to trade Kleros for an intermediary then trade that for fiat. For instance, you could trade Kleros for ETH  and then trade the ETH for fiat.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why are some cryptos(XCM,PRQ) priced differently in Coinmetro than their Blockfolio reading? They'll typically be a few cents off. Is Blockfolio just not quick enough?

Blockfolio gets its prices from many exchanges at once and gets an aggregate price. There will no doubt be some discrepancy between its price and the price you see on one particular exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I also have a Ledger Nano S wallet. I suppose this is obvious, but the only benefit to using that as opposed to the Coinbase wallet would be if I wanted to hold crypto right? I assume it would be inconvenient for active trading but I'm unfamiliar with the software element of Ledger and could be completely wrong.

Storing your crypto on a Ledger Nano S wallet would be for additional security. It would store your crypto and private keys such that they wouldn't be exposed to the internet. There would be additional steps involved with trading them, yes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Why do I need ETH for miner's fees on Coinbase and Uniswap? Do I just have to always have ETH? Is there any way around this?

ETH is required to interact with the Ethereum network. Moving Ethereum-based tokens between wallets costs miner's fees (aka gas). Uniswap is a decentralized exchange so using Uniswap means interacting with the Ethereum network directly. Therefore all trades on Uniswap cost gas."

This also has the side effect of encouraging more and more efficient and greener forms of cooling and electrical production.

Real estate can be a great investment when done correctly. There are good and bad investments/investors. Regarding the user above talking about his friend that went 10 months with no tenant: if it's not compelling, it's not selling (renting in his case). Improve the property or lower the rent. Why go 10 months with 100% loss instead of maybe 10-20% loss? Anyways, people have their reasons and I am not here to judge.

In my market area, flipping or buying rentals to hold is best done with a ""team"" including a real estate agent (provides in depth market data), contractors (fix or improve properties), title co (1031 exchanges), lender (loans and special financing), accountant (those taxes, write offs, etc.). ""How do I form this team?"" you ask? Well networking and referrals is a good way to go about it. There area already people investing in real estate and all you have to do is reach out and learn from others and get referrals for their contacts. 

Note: this is from my experience in my specific market area so your plan and resources will differ. When you think of real estate you have to look are it from top to all the way down to hyper local. So national data, state data, county, city, zip code, school district, neighborhood, street (views of the lake or views of a busy street?)."

This is the exact situation my friend found himself in, he was without the 2 tenants he needed to make his mortgage payment for 10 out of 12 months in the year. His Dad bails him out monthly. The reason? Too many similar or better properties for similar or cheaper rent. Saturated market.

You'll notice that neither monero nor Bytecoin are mentioned in the paper itself, but the source code for either is simply one implementation of this white paper. I consider the original author of a cc to be the author of the white paper since they are the ones defining the rules of the idea. Any source code is going to be an approximation of that idea. The devs for the source code will have varying degrees of their preferred anonymity based on whatever they release publicly about their activity with the project. However, it's worth noting that the public GitHub repository for the project has [no public members](https://github.com/orgs/monero-project/people).

While it's possible the actual human being that authored CNv2 with the NvS pseudonym is not a contributor to the monero project, I think that is unlikely. In either case, my point stands since the contributors for the source code are also anonymous, and therefore fit the criteria for being anonymously authored. No such claim can be made for Nano."

&amp;#x200B;

I started buying btc in 2016, and have been holding only btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years."

Average internet speeds in the developed world are around 2 MB/s, but many people have way faster than that. Surely it is no problem at all to download blocks a few MB in size. It only takes 1 second. Storage, internet speed and computation power will only improve in the near future."

But your original post suggests there's some kind of intrinsic reason why BTC's market cap *should* grow, which is simply not true. It's a free market, and investors will do the things they think will make them the most money. If that means buying and selling alts, they'll do that. And if the fractions of % being skimmed off in exchange fees are enough to curb BTC's growth or even derail it in a broader, longer-term sense, then that says more about BTC than it does about alts. 

Over time, assuming crypto as a whole continues to develop, the markets will mature. There IS new money coming in via the 'front door', even if dark pools and leverage trading remain factors. More 'normal' people will get involved, who aren't interested in crazy trading. Speculation will give way to more tangible valuation, which in turn will yield market caps that actually mean something. Competition among exchanges will reduce fees. And if BTC is really as good as its proponents think it is, it'll be just fine at the end of it all, whatever happens with alts."

The share goes up or down based on the valuation, but the key point is that the dividend isn't paid in shares, it's paid in fiat cash. Perhaps I am getting this mixed up with another discussion. As for where to put money now? up to the individual, no idea. I have been putting money into crypto every time it goes deep into the red and no one wants to buy it - been profitable so far. I diversify heavily though to avoid getting stung, so I'm betting on the market as a whole. Actually I'm betting on people wanting to throw money at crypto when it goes green.

trading is a niche side show for the real purpose of what cryptos were designed for.   
The reason why BTC will never reach the ATH again is because the only reason it went up so high was due to over hyped fear of missing out by a majority naive target audience.    
The fact is the majority of people are no longer naive what cryptos are. And all the people who were left holding heavy bags are still around and they make up about 60% of the holders who bought between 14K and 18K. Shaking those bag holders is going to take years and years.   
It is the only reason BTC is higher than 6K and the only reason why it will never reach more than 15K.    
BTC is over priced accept the truth and you will see how the market will move.   

At the end of the day trading is minute part of the market, get your emotions out of it to see clearer."

It's highly unlikely than any single payment system (cryptocurrency or otherwise) will displace ALL existing payment processors, and it doesn't need to - it takes a LONG time to obtain that many customers. In 2019, 185.5 billion purchases were made via Visa, 131 Billion via UnionPay, 108 billion MasterCard, ~16 billion for Amex/JCB/Discover, totaling ~14000 TPS average. It's highly unlikely that any existing cryptocurrency can (or should) handle that load. Achieving even just Discover-level adoption (~44 million users) would be a huge achievement for any cryptocurrency, and at Discover usage rates that's ~95 TPS average

https://www.statista.com/statistics/261327/number-of-per-card-credit-card-transactions-worldwide-by-brand-as-of-2011/

It's better to start with more realistic targets: for example, achieving 100 million users for any one cryptocurrency. Even Bitcoin is only at ~8 million users per 2018 Chainalysis estimates. 2011 PayPal was doing ~57 TPS average, with 100 million customers, 2019 Discover is at ~95 TPS with ~44 million customers. Nano can handle that same load now, and even without protocol improvements Nano automatically improves roughly in line with Moore's law"

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

Not really. Imagine you staked a crypto token and you received BTC or Eth. Suddenly the token isn't just reproducing more of itself, it's giving you wealth (in the form of something not related to it)

That's proper value creation. Most financial assets do that. You buy shares, they give you cash dividends. You buy bonds, they give you cash interest. You buy land, it gives you rent in the form of cash.

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

To earn/store moons you will need to download the reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page). [Then you can login to your vault on web once it’s set up.](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/i8kj2m/moons_announcement_now_you_can_use_your_moons_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

You earn moons with karma in the community, once a month Reddit submits a list of contributors to the subreddit in order of karma to see who gets what percentage of the issuance. The issuance is scheduled to be 5,000,000 per month dropping 2.5% each month until a max supply of 250,000,000 is hit (including burned moons). Reddit keeps 30%, the mods get 10%, and 10% is reserved for the broader reddit community with the remaining 50% being distributed to contributors.

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc. That costs 1,000 moons per month in our sub &amp; 500 bricks per month in r/FortNiteBR (their issuance is half of ours). They also want us to trade them within the community and eventually on uniswap or idex once they transition to mainnet. 

People can also tip you moons directly if they like your comment. To tip a user just hit the moon icon next to their username and put the amount of moons you want to send (this feature was removed on iOS because Apple sucks). Another way to tip moons is to go to your vault and hit the send button at the top right, input the username you want to tip + the amount of moons you want to tip and hit send.

You can’t buy moons from reddit (there are some exchanges popping up like xmoon) but they plan to allow you to purchase them with USD so you can redeem them for the premium membership. When you use your moons to buy premium they burn half of them forever, and the other half are re-introduced on the next issuance period. If you buy premium with cash Reddit will burn moons on your behalf.

Reddit launched [the great scaling bake off](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) &amp; proposals just closed last month.

It’s worth mentioning that r/ethtrader’s [donuts](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/donut) just got listed on uniswap and broke $0.02 with a $1 million market cap &amp; $100,000 24hr trading volume."

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

I say if you really want the card, go for it. If there is a dip after buying, it's frustrating, but I wouldn't worry too much because the crypto market will most probably recover from any short term crash (for example, I bought cro at $0.5 in February and it felt like a bad decision because it dropped to around $0.3 a few weeks later in March.

Well bitcoin used to be cheap enough for the 5 billion unbanked in the world to use. That’s what separated it from Fiat. A financial system that can be used on chain, with self custody, without permission.  A financial system that can be used directly which is separate from the State. 

Nobody has gotten the memo yet that when the developers crippled the chain and made fees too expensive, they outpriced these 5 billion people that actually would’ve benefited from bitcoin. People living under oppressive governments, having their bank accounts emptied to pay national debts.

This was the mantra of bitcoin for 7 years. Until Blockstream came in and decided to monetize it for their own selfish gain. 

So to answer your question, even if all this banking shit was happening, bitcoin was still supposed to be usable permissionlessly, by people directly, using only an app."

However I don't think investor protection rules are that easily transferable to the crypto market. Applying the same transparency rules in the crypto markets would mean officially linking what’s supposed to be a decentralized asset to a centralized organisation (that doesn't even have an official connection to the asset as an issuer). That goes against a pretty fundamental ideal of cryptos. 

Also the IF doesn't directly rely on our investments. They were donated a significant amount that rises and falls with speculation, but it's not as if the fiat we use to buy IOTA goes straight into their pocket like with IPO's. That may sound nitpicky, as market trust and sentiment obviously affect their bottom line immensely, but the legal connection isn't (and arguably shouldn't be) there.

Going back to my comparison to gold; mining companies aren't beholden to the people that speculate on the price of gold, even if they stand to gain from that speculation, because there's no legal connection between the two and no basis for one.

While there has surely been some profits on holding physical gold a lot of those gains are tied up in just maintaining purchasing power rather than all being pure profit.

You don’t want fiat on your books at a time like this you want assets that will inflate in price and keep up with the inflation of the monetary supply. If you are trying to beat inflation to make profits (and by profits I mean even greater purchasing power than when you started) you are taking on greater risk than usual because the system is on a knifes edge.

For supply chain, Walmart would be better off to use their own chain run on their own servers. Attackers? It has no monetary value. Trusted vs trustless? Walmart already trusts itself.

For large corporations, there are no advantages to basing their supply chain management on a publicly traded chain. A private chain on an intranet (non-public large network) has zero value to attackers whereas a publicly traded chain incentivizes exploiters.

What it means if it keep going and inflates faster is that you are going to start to see more meaningful changes in your day to day goods prices. This inflation makes sure that people are not sitting on their money and hoarding it because it’s devaluing and instead are spending it which keeps the economy ticking over, if money is not flowing though the economy that will cause a depression.

Here's my argument, and I feel it's valid.

It seems that most people purchase crypto to eventually trade out of it. In that sense it's an emerging market, or a foreign exchange.

If not, the alternative is holding until real utility, street utility, becomes common. Like purchasing apples and pies at a farmstand. People could be doing that today.

Suppose that JPM did have some kind of payment token for their private blockchain, call it jpmETH.  It would presumably be used to pay for computation on the private eth-like chain that jpm runs which would presumably mean financial transactions etc.

Now, how does this differ from just paying JPM for those services as your bank/broker or whatever?  If JPM were then to share that blockchain with competitors so that you can use jpmETH to purchase financial services of other firms (say, idk, Schwab), then how is any of this different from how the same firms could partner with each other on a subscription model without any blockchains involved?

If the existence of this subscription model possibility does not threaten Ethereum, then neither does a private chain model.  After all, a private chain is just an immutable database.  Not saying there won't be private chains, just that they have a different use case entirely and there is no reason that they even need a monetary token.

EDIT: They don't need a monetary token because the company could just charge subscription fees for using their private chain."

Anyone can sit in their basement and make something and label it ""money"" or a ""currency"". In order to avoid the chaos of everyone (including criminals) making their own currencies, countries tend to have a singular national tender

Typically this national currency gets value from that fact that it is: backed by the state, is inherently tied to the value of goods/services in the economy, has full legal and regulatory certainty, is accepted everywhere as legal tender, has stability mechanisms influenced and acted upon by a relatively independent state body, etc.

All that gives it it's value (as a medium of exchange) Therefore if it produces more of itself that value gain can be real (depending on amount, indirectly create too much and it too loses value)

A token that just produces more of itself is simply a basement made thing artificially producing more of itself. The only way it gains value is if the creator manages to get it listed on a speculative secondary market where traders and investors speculate (and gamble) on it's value in fiat. It's not linked to prices in an economy in any way, it's not linked to the economy, it's not linked to the state or anything. It can be given an ROI of whatever the creator chooses. 

So if you have X crypto coin that has an ROI of 30%. It simply produces 30% more of itself a year, which expands the supply and *should* dilute value (ultimately). Some investors mistakenly compare that to fiat returning the same amount (30%)"

Tax is the opposite of money printing, central banks manage inflation rates and risk by informing governments of fiscal parameters to target 2% inflation. When money is taxed it is destroyed and therefore deflates the money supply. 

We don’t really know how much money printing is too much or when we would see inflation. We’re in unprecedented times at the moment but who knows how long the game can keep going. 

The USD is a special case though. As a reserve currency, a pricing for world oil markets, and used as currency in many countries the demand for USD has outstripped the supply for a long time.

We can exchange our mined token INSTANTLY for Ethereum or other tokens. We can transfer our coin CHEAPLY because we are a very cheap token to send. We are the best iteration of Bitcoin since Bitcoin and here is why.  


We run whole exchanges on ETHEREUM and we run our TOKEN on ETHEREM, we get to transact on chain with Ethereum, LINK holders love it, we love it.  


0xBitcoin, a cryptocurrency using Proof-of-Work to FAIRLY distribute erc20 tokens using Bitcoins mining model on and backed by the Ethereum blockchain.  


With 0xBitcoin it is a still possible to mine 1 coin a day on a 1080 ti or better. costs 0 ETH to mine coins!  


No premine or dev fee or unfair practice were given on launch. The code has not been hacked or upgraded since launch! We have cheapest erc20 transactions.  


0xBitcoin miners solve a complicated hash from the Ethereum blockchain that gives them the reward of a block (currently 50 coins) and submit that proof to Ethereum blockchain (which gives a new challange hash for them to solve).  


0xBitcoin is the first ERC20 Mineable Token. Running for over 2.5 years! First reward halfing in \~2.5 years. No hacks/scams/pre-mine/dev fee/ or cheat available, it was public the first day it was on the blockchain (Feb 2018) with a public miner.  


It has a price of 0.11$ at the moment and only 21 million will exist  


0xBTC mined @ 6.2 million (Circulating supply)  
First halfing @ 10.5 million

First off let's establish a basic understanding. When bitcoin first began the transactions per block were effectively similar. The entire network ran on one computer. This means TPS per block was ""very efficient""! Never mind that a bad actor with knowledge could have attacked the network at that point with minimal infrastructure. But who was incentivized to attack something that was worth nothing? No one. It's only when something is valuable that you try to take by force.
Hypothetically you could create HUGE blocks on a super small time interval and, if you're lucky, and no value is placed behind the network, it would become ""super efficient"" by your metric. And there are a lot of chains who do this! Hell, you should make a fork and sell this as a concept to people, because frankly, stupid people are buying this concept and you'd make a lot of money.
The reason these metrics were chosen (in my opinion - no one can know this for sure) is because it allows for similar TPS of intrabank settlement (our existing base layer requirement for settlement - which is what bitcoin does - securely settle. Visa could not settle transactions without a secure base layer) while also maximizing security against attack risk.
All you have to do is look at network hashrate versus network value. The more valuable a network is the more security it should have to dissuade attackers. What you are actually measuring is the cost to attack a network, not it's energy per transaction. The total energy spent could as easily be 25w as 250000 MW, but I know where I would place my faith. 
And is it bad that energy is being used for security? Well lets look at market forces... If you are not at .03/kWh you really cannot compete anymore. It's very difficult to go lower than this, but most miners who do are soaking up dead load or renewable load to achieve this. Bitcoin mining is actually driving the adoption of good TOU practices and or investments into renewable sources.
Do I think you're an idiot? Well maybe you've never considered these variables. But if you are objective and still come to the same conclusions, then yes I do."

'Tis with immense pleasure that I inform you that your letter has found safe travel to my destination and landed in my hands.  However, this pleasure was fated to remain short lived and bittersweet, for I also admit to you, regardless of what distress it may cause to you, knowing you went to great trouble to pen it and deliver it to me, that I in fact declined to open it and refused to read the message contained within.  Surmising your intentions, there exists no doubt in my heart regarding your sincere worries for my financial well being, but alas your attempts to convince me to modify my investment strategies shall regretfully remain futile, as my stubbornness in this matter has indeed been sealed irrevocably and no other voice shall rock its imperturbable foundations.  Allow me then to reiterate my will once more, and do your best to forever remember it for no change will follow:  I shan't part ways with my beloved chainlink for it is my utmost belief that i have invested wisely and foresee infinite potential in its future, and therefore no other possession in this world shall change my decision, not even a mountain of gold!  For my possessed asset is indeed fated to be worth more than any other riches in the world.  We shan't speak of this no more.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely yours,

Your beloved friend.

I agree that price action was baked in on the BTC side from larger investors, but also keep in mind that BTC crashed alongside with the market albeit its recovery was a couple of days after the sp500 bottomed out. Although, if we want to be fair, the Nasdaq is a better market to compare BTC to since it's a growth index that's tech-driven and arguably has a similar demographic of investors. When looking at the Nasdaq, BTC's bottom was printed about 10 days prior to the Nasdaq bottom, but Nasdaq broke its Feb high about a month sooner and with more conviction that BTC did. As with gold, the price rebounded even quicker than the Nasdaq and has appreciated roughly about the same as BTC in the same timeframe post-crash.
2. Definitely agree, still early days or maybe BTC's days are numbered, we won't know until the dust clears. The Dotcom crash was supposed to be the end of a lot of companies, but instead they came back even stronger and are not at the forefront.

&gt;Energy equals security. 

Both of these systems are spending energy on security. Bitcoin's security is vastly superior to the fiat system's security, but that alone cannot justify  529.35 kWh per transaction. Bitcoin needs to get 1,000 times more efficient before it has a chance at absorbing a significant percentage of the transactions currently being performed in the fiat system.

At its current efficiency ratio, we literally cannot produce enough energy on Earth for Bitcoin to process 368.8 billion transactions a year.

I'm certain Bitcoin will become more efficient with 1st and 2nd layer improvements over time. But right now, this is the state of things: Bitcoin uses an unsustainable amount of energy."

1) most price action is already baked in by the larger institutional investors (as it also was in the broader stock market). We did trend downward, which was not ideal, but gold was also negatively impacted by today’s news

2) retail traders and existing whales are still the primary drivers of the BTCs price. While institutions are slowly on boarding, they are in more of a hold-and-see approach as opposed to active day trading

Look at the bigger picture, 99.9% of us were caught off guard by defi. Reddit had no clue, buy nano guys. Most of the defi coins were ATL in the spring and late last year.

In reallity all it really took was your average crypto normie to google eth and finance one drunken night, and if they had any smarts would have dropped 10k on random defi projects.

You think once normies find out they can make 6 percent APY from their money off a stable coin, with an app that’s as easy to use as their bank app, they won’t throw their money in it? The interest gained has never been seen before and blows away all bank savings and CD rates. And that’s just dipping their toe into what DeFi has to offer.

There is no chance it will be possible for the world to use as a currency when it can only handle 4 transactions per second. 

The centralization of miners is not a HUGE problem unless the possibility of China shutting them down or taking them over happens. I’m not saying that it’s likely, but it’s foolish to say that it’s impossible. Along with the centralization of miners [the rich list proves that we will have a new 1%.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rich-list-high) 1000 BTC is held by 2200 wallets and of those wallets a majority of them hold well over 1000 BTC. The early adopters and whales hold a majority of BTC in circulation. [Grayscale bought 33% of all newly minted BTC](https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-buys-33-of-all-bitcoin-mined-in-last-three-months/). 

I don’t argue that it’s a good asset to invest in, like digital gold. But that’s where it ends for me. There is no use case for it to be adopted for daily spending, the fees and speeds are ridiculous. Unless it’s used as a credit system with a centralized authority(like VISA, Mastercard or Grayscale because they’ll have most of it at this rate) providing verification of funds for exchanges to happen then using it for spending is highly unlikely to happen. 

Mining is also not very sustainable going forward. The argument against is that it uses a lot of power. The argument for is “it’s all renewable energy” and “it proves value that it’s *hard earned money* unlike fiat” but it’s still not helpful toward going green. If you haven’t heard the earth isn’t exactly getting healthier[(although covid did her some favours allowing some breathing time)](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52485712). Proof of Work requires far too much power to think we can handle another 120 years of Bitcoin mining.

Bitcoin as it is today, only allows a certain number of transactions to be written in a block which is mined from time to time. The block size and the time it takes to mine it is pretty much unchangeable for now. This means if you have an increase in usage, the number of transactions to be written could increase at a bigger rate than those actually being written. This poses a big issue that need to be addressed if you want bitcoin as a currency. Also it makes the fees go up. If you're talking about processing power scaling, it's not as big of an issue because the progrem itself adjusts the difficulty of the algorythm according to the processing power of the network. Making the mining of the blocks take more or less the same time independently of the processing power.

This takes us to your second point

Centralization: there's one big company producing specific hardware to mine bitcoin. This hardware is so efficient compared to traditional computers it has rendered them useless. It's called bitmain and it's a Chinese company. Their business model is creating this hardware, use it till they create a newer, better, more efficient model, AND ONLY then, sell it. This means that have a monopoly (or at least makes them the most powerful) bitcoin mining company as only they have the better hardware to do so. This creates a series of thechincal threats to bitcoin, none of which have happened (yet), and still remain on paper, like 51% attack

Other issues with bitcoin would be

PoW: position of work is seen as many as a problem. It means bitcoin must spend (much much) energy to mine blocks. It's stated that the bitcoin network spends as much as a nuclear power plant of energy to work (or so, I read it on this sub reddit a few day ago). This is wasted energy because all its doing is solving mathematical problems. The thing is, no other ""proof of... "" is as tested or as ""certainly"" secure as this. Ethereum supposedly will change to PoStake and then we might see if it's better.
But even if PoS is better there's another problem bitcoin faces, which is directly connected to the centralization problem..

Difficulty in change: to change the bitcoin protocol, the software needs to be changed and most users must start using the new software. If the changes are relevant enough this creates what you might have heard before, a fork. First of all, this means if a new technology appears, and people want to implement it on bitcoin, it must be so overwhelmingly clear its a good addition to the protocol, that most users actually take the time to download the new program and use it. If it's not (and I mean if it's not clear that's a good addition,like increasing the block size, some want it, some don't) , then most wouldn't use it and it doesn't become part of the bitcoin protocol. And even if it's clear, you have some centralization in the form of bitmains hardware (as said before) so they could boycott the application of new good software only because it hinders their profit. BUT this also has some benefits. It means the application of malicious software, even if most people think it's good, is hindered.

There are also many other problems that many other cryptos try (and are able to) solve. The thing is, bitcoin has 60% of the crypto market cap, belongs to no one and has endured the test of time. These three factors surpass any other problems it might have, at least for the time being.

The Fed can make a big show about capitalizing banks balance sheets but that means jack shit if they don't actually start lending or people start borrowing money. They aren't and were not, 80% of stimulus money is sitting untouched as depository reserves. 

They tried to reach the 2% inflation target for an entire decade post 2008 they hit it once briefly, that was before the economy was cut in half.

The far more likely scenario is deflation from 2 decades of expansive monetary policy. In the 80's we had a limited monetary base with the gold standard an excessive velocity creating inflation. The fix was raise fed rate to 20% cutting off commercial banks, lower lending standards and make credit easier to get making them lend. Expand the monetary base with credit expansion, This actually worked back then. 

Now we have the opposite problem today we have a uncontrollable massively huge monetary base from 40 years of credit expansion. We have the highest unemployment in history, lowest consumer demand, lowest monetary velocity, lowest demand for new debt. All points to deflation not inflation. 

Then why did we get this little pop of inflation since March. #1 people frantically selling their dollars fearing inflation that's not there and #2 the pause of all debt in forebearance since March.

The key innovations in our new consensus statement reflect the changes in the economy I described. Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.

With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal. This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24 This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.

In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market. It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation. The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.

We have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate. Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent. Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent. Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down. To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.

In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average. Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26 Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula. Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.

The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework. To an extent, these revisions reflect the way we have been conducting policy in recent years. At the same time, however, there are some important new features. Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. In conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all Americans. And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time."

As I mentioned before I worked for a company with whom I patented an idea. This idea was already in use by their customers! So how was the patent granted? Because patent reviewers don’t know enough about specific topics and/or don’t have access to relevant details. Because patents are deliberately written vaguely to try and expand their scope, while occasionally mentioning something specific so they don’t get rejected as too vague by those reviewers who don’t know enough to tell said specific mention is even remotely relevant. So they mentioned some specific stuff - a little bit like this one does with iota - and it was almost pot luck what they (we - I wrote it!) chose given we just had to say something specific and as long as it covered enough use cases then, who cares?! So even specific mentions don’t mean a lot except - optimistically - that that mention covers the most potential use cases the patent could cover. Even though literally it is **never** going to be utilised. 

Furthermore, but patents can’t be defended if the idea was already around! I hear you cry. No they can’t, but it still takes a lot of money to defend that and many companies can’t afford or have the will to do it. Which is why patents benefit large corporations so disproportionately. And that’s why large corporations can abuse them so easily as few people can afford to challenge and then spending $1000/y/patent or whatever is peanuts to them.

Furthrfurthermore, the reason for the patent wasn’t to stop them doing what they were already doing, it was to stop them doing a very slight variation which would have stopped my company getting as much profit from the current set-up. But, and here’s the really important point you don’t get, my company didn’t think for a second that the customers would do that because there’s various reasons why it wouldn’t be so good for them overall. But my company did the patent *anyway*. Why? “Just in case” and because “patents cost peanuts” to large corporations relative to the revenue they make. Plus there’s tax deductions for work classified as R&amp;D which makes patent - even ones that contain no actual work (but who the fuck knows?) - near free to these corporations if they can tax deduct them for at least some of their existence. So they did a “no brainier” because the relative cost to do it was so much lower than what they *might* lose, even though they thought there was basically no chance of that ever happening. So not only was the patent **never** going to be used, they didn’t expect anyone to **ever** breach it. 

And that’s one example of the types of perverse reasons that corporations make patents. So, I say again, the patent system is broken and large corporations making patents is essentially meaningless. Whether you want to accept that or not. 

This is why patent trolls exist because corporations are doing this **all the time**. Patent trolls literally couldn’t exist if it wasn’t for these constant pointless patents. I repeat, the information patents given about a company’s intention to exploit it, or expectation that anyone else will, is extremely minimal. That’s it."

No, it doesn't, independent of development, the recognition itself is already exciting too

&gt; I’m telling you, repeatedly, that the existence of patents means very little.

You are repeatedly telling something completely wrong. It means that they take IOTA seriously, which is exciting and says a lot about IOTA's adoption alone.

&gt; They won’t need to patent others if this patent also covers those. I said it was cheap not that they’re idiots. You write the patent to cover the widest possible interpretation - so it covers many. I’ve literally explained this point already. Read the damn patent, it obviously name checks IOTA as a crypto because it in principle can do things other can’t. Therefore this patent covers IOTA and all those others, without even name checking them.

You talking completely bullshit, of course this patent doesn't cover all other DLT technologies, at best it would cover very similar ones to IOTA and Blockchains, but nothing else. They explicitly describe what the tangle is and what it. You can't simply speak about the Tangle, and mean something completely else. 

&gt; So, again, all this might mean is that IOTA is better than others. It does not mean they have even the tiniest intent of using it.

Its wrong to say that it does not mean, it might mean they have even the tiniest intent of using it., we just don't know

&gt; And if they’re not, then this patent is meaningless in the context of whether it means “exciting times” or not.

Bullshit, even if they don't have the intent of using it for a fact, them acknowledging IOTA would still be exciting instead, that is what matters.

&gt; It’s literally irrelevant to IOTA or IOTA’s development except to say someone’s noticed it’s potentially a bit better Han other cryptos for a use case that overlaps with their business. But unless and until someone does anything with that, the most you can say is it’s the mildest of compliments.

its not even a compliment in a positive sense necessarily, they might even be hating it that IOTA exists at all, yet, they still take it seriously, that aspect is the exciting thing here

&gt; For all we know crypto’s in total, including IOTA, will never be used in this use case or anything as “exciting” therefore name checking IOTA is nothing significant

No, we don't know that.

&gt; It doesn’t matter if they name check iota or any other crypto if none of those crypto’s go on to do anything interesting in that context.

It matters a lot that they explicitly not only mention IOTA/Tangle multiple times but also describe it. And that is the point, there ARE other cryptocurrencies they could mention, but they don't, they focus on IOTA.

&gt; Being the best of a range of technologies that never get implemented is not very exciting.

How do you know they wont get it implemented with IOTA again?

&gt; It’s not that I don’t want this to be meaningful

Yea I can guess that you don’t want this to be not meaningful, I believe you, but you just want to hide that your way of thinking was wrong when taking e a closer look, you dont want to look wrong, yet you are wrong, this definitively is something exciting for crypto and especially for IOTA.

&gt; but I’m not going to let that preference override an objective assessment of whether it is meaningful. It isn’t meaningful, I know this because I have an understanding of how the patent system works

It is objectively something exciting for IOTA, this patent application clearly indicates IOTA's adoption.

&gt; You, on the other hand, clearly haven’t the foggiest and are stuck with thinking it works like in the 1900s - so you’re waaaaaay over-interpreting this. You just can’t/won’t accept your wrong because you don’t want to be wrong.

The whole thing just indicates that they take IOTA seriously, which is exciting, try ignoring that harder, you are only reflecting your feelings, you are the one who is wrong and can't accept it, I never over interpreted here anything, you on the other hand try desperately to talk this down."

&gt;If bitcoin has properties you view as valuable or necessary for your situation, why would you bother with anything else?

Well, if that is the case, then yes by all means stick to it. The thing is, to work as global currency, being ~~easy to use~~ cheap, fast and easy to implement are also aspects that shouldn't be neglected. I was heavily invested in Bitcoin at first until I discovered Raiblocks/Nano (don't take this as a shill). It has all the features I mentioned including the security that bitcoin gives. I am not trying to convince you to change your investment, just note that superior technology is there, ready to be used and eventually (this is the speculation part/my opinion) will take over.

Finally, a currency like Nano has all the aspects and benefits to be used as emergency funds, business reserves and others you mentioned. 

A simple way I look at it is that it's a Bitcoin 2.0, how Satoshi might have envisioned it. Bitcoin has a lot of work to do to get on that level. I feel LN fails at delivering and I am personally not fan of the way POW mining works and the energy it consumes. That's why I am not ""bullish"" on BTC and rather support the better solution. As always I will happily jump ship if something better comes out."

They won’t need to patent others if this patent also covers those. I said it was cheap not that they’re idiots. You write the patent to cover the widest possible interpretation - so it covers many. I’ve literally explained this point already. Read the damn patent, it obviously name checks IOTA as a crypto because it in principle can do things other can’t.
