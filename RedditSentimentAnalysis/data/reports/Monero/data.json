2. Add `--ban-list block.txt` as daemon (monerod) startup flag. 

3. Restart `monerod`

**If you run `Simple mode`**

1. Go to the `Settings` page and close the current wallet.

2. Switch to `Advanced mode`

3. Reopen your wallet via the `Open a wallet from file` option. 

4. Go to the `Settings` page -&gt; `Node` tab and select `Remote node`

I have a laptop sitting in a closet with a hdd that I use as a remote node for BTC and it works well.
I would like it to run monderod too and to be able to use it as a remote not on lan (from windows with the gui)

The lan address of the server is 192.168.0.50 but I cannot for the life of me figure out a monerod command that will allow me to connect to it from another machine on lan from the gui.

Where I am now : 
I start monerod with :

    ./monerod --detach  --rpc-restricted-bind-port 18089 --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18081 --confirm-external-bind --public-node
    
 I opened the 18081 port with iptable on the server with:
 
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 18081 -j ACCEPT

I try to connect to it on the GUI (from another machine on the same LAN network with):


    address: 192.168.0.50   port:18081


The GUI says connecting for a few seconds but switch back to disconnecting...
Also I am still syncink the blockchain but I do not think it should matter though.


I have not open any port on my router yet as so far I do not want it to be a public node, (just for the lan network)

Or the move to proof of stake, which is again increasing centralization; rich (aka Vitalik and his premine) get richer.

I don't see any issues with cross chain atomic swaps with Eth. As long as people use it, it's good for monero.

Also, while your 70% premine is techincally true, your presentation of it amounts to a deception. It's not like they just kept those coins in some reserve to slowly dump on the market at every spike like scams do. It was an immediate sale to people who wanted to become involved in the project and be exposed to potential price explosion, but didn't have the mining hardware to do so. 

Given the extraordinary centralization of the mining ecosystem, a very good argument (even an accurate and correct argument) can be made that Eth distribution was vastly more egalitarian and decentralized than the original Bitcoin distribution. As of now, I think most of the remaining 12% has already been sold off to pay develpment costs.

Anyways, we probably shouldn't get into it too much, because this is a Monero forum.

Nobody has given any evidence in support of the claim that XMR does not fit this definition. Rather in fact, every argument clearly shows that it does. XMR is a cryptocoin, which is an equity instrument that may lose or gain value, and the ""central entity"" in this case is the Monero blockchain. You cannot hold XMR outside of the blockchain. You cannot move or trade it outside of the chain. All transactions occur only in the chain.

And no, I'm not using ""stable"" to mean the value never changes at all. I'm using ""stable"" to mean, people can rely on it not having a significant change in value in day to day life. When people can use it daily to pay for rent, food, energy, entertainment, in their daily lives, then it will have succeeded in its goal of being a currency. But there area far too many things in the way of meeting that goal currently.

Fine, call it _asset_ instead of security, but the same facts still hold. There is nobody lobbying governments to empower Monero as a fundamentally used currency, rather in fact only lobbyists arguing against cryptoassets in favor of banks. Anything is ""currency"" in a world where bartering is done; and that's what the dark web is.

Upon completion of this transition, Abra will no longer be a wallet: rather, it will be (perhaps already is) a *custodial account provider*. I'll not use the word “bank”, since that has regulatory implications, but it's something close, especially now that they're paying interest on some coins.

Moreover, the above quote implies that it never was fully noncustodial for XMR. If I remember correctly, Abra originally allowed its customers to hold synthetic Monero in some kind of funky smart contract (written in Bitcoin script...) that apparently gave the beneficial owner a modicum of collateral. Now that it's going fully custodial, I guess the operators may as well switch to holding actual (as opposed to synthetic) XMR on behalf of /u/Everything &amp; the rest of their customers.

I think the most major problem facing crypto now and most likely in the future is government regulation as the usage of currency becomes more feasible as overinflation of the dollar continues. 

If and/or when the regulations begin funnelling in, I think what matters most is how the majority of crypto holders perceive cryptocurrency as a whole; as a new wave of currency to potentially replace fiat in a private and decentralized way, or as a simple stock which they want to make a profit from. If the latter, my fear is that the increase in regulations will simply make said people not see the profit as worth it if its potentially breaking the law.

If the former, this is where I see monero becoming extremely vital. The people who want to continute holding crypto as a message, hobby, revolution, whatever, will need a coin they can keep private, anonymous, and protected from government regulation.

I'm new to this, this is my understanding so somebody please correct me if I'm wrong. 

There's nobody to call for monero. If I take money out of an atm and get mugged, the bank isn't going to refill my account the amount of money stolen. With other coins, somebody may be able able to report some coin as stolen or involved in something criminal, which can make it harder to spend the stolen coin. With monero's fungibility and privacy features, the monero in my wallet and your wallet are the same, doesn't matter if you bought it, received it as payment, or mined it. If it's stolen, you can't trace where it went or who it went to. Using my examples of stolen credit card information vs. Stolen cash, both thieves go to the same bar and sit down. The credit card thief's stolen credit card is declined, his money is no good there. The cash thief can spend all the stolen cash he wants, it's much harder to prove that the rightful owner of that cash is someone else. The credit card has a different name on it than the id,  it's pretty obvious. To figure out if that cash is my stolen cash we'd need video evidence, fingerprints on the bills, check the serial numbers (do atms record the serial numbers of the cash they put out and who has it? Good question I'm about to research.) also depending on the amount and what you use monero for, you might not want to try to recover it. I would, because there's nothing criminal about me and monero, I just think it's a cool way to make my $3000 computer that I only use for Netflix perform, like working on an old car to try to get more power out of it. Because a racecar going 170 mph is one thing, but a Honda civic that you can get up to 170 mph even though it's just a daily driver is considered by some to be ""pretty badass,"" but monero's decentralization and focus on privacy inherently put more responsibility on the end user. Or more bluntly, ""you wanted nobody to be able to track your coins, now your coins are gone and nobody knows where."" the monkey's paw.

Nodes failing to relay transactions may be caused by the [ongoing network attacks](https://old.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/k9d0hu/a_brief_breakdown_of_moneros_ongoing_network/), or in some cases badly configured nodes (to node operators: please don't use --tx-proxy if you run a public node, this is why).

Trying to resend a failed transaction by constructing a new one isn't an ideal solution because the second transaction isn't guaranteed to use the same inputs as the first. The ""failed"" transaction may still end up getting relayed by the node, so both transactions can get confirmed eventually. This can lead to a loss of funds if the address you are sending to doesn't belong to you, or you happen to transact with an uncooperative merchant or exchange.

The solution to this is to rebroadcast the original transaction, however unfortunately no wallet currently supports this. I will add come functionality to Feather soon that will allow you to right click on a failed transaction and rebroadcast it.","[1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 23]"

It can't do any such thing. At most it might slide through some loopholes, until those loopholes get fixed.

The central purpose of Monero is directly contrary to the central purpose of all AML/KYC regulations, which is to make it possible to trace from whom and where all significant movements of money come, and to whom and where all significant movements of money go.

&gt;  Push for new regulation: Monero should push for new pro-privacy regulation to provide positive guard rails for privacy moving forward.

That has zero chance of working, because there are powerful entrenched interests in favor of more transparency, and no correspondingly powerful interests in favor of more privacy. There is no political support and no political path available. At most you might be able to stave off the closing of some of those loopholes... for a while.

You can not look it up on the blockchain (obviously) to verify what the address holds.

Getting access to the funds means converting that paper wallet into a hot wallet (recovery using the seed words)

I normally dislike the hardware wallet approach - for Bitcoin and friends - because paper wallets for those coins can be verified. You only need the private key of a BTC paper wallet, and you do not need to rely on a hardware supplier continuing to exist if you need to purchase replacement hardware.

However, for Monero, using a Trezor (or Nano) seems infinitely more functional than paper wallets without compromising the 'cold storage' attribute.

At the moment, after some experimenting with trivial amounts, the only 'issue' I have not resolved with my Trezor T is how to recover Monero when you only have a twelve word seed.  They have guides for recovery of BTC and others into software wallets (Electrum) .. but not for recovery of XMR into any of the software wallets.

I am seriously considering purchase of a spare Trezor T .. just as a backup rather than for usage.","[1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24]"

Isn't ""the community"" decentralized enough that we can hold different groups of people defending different types of services? You most definitely don't need to praise such institution. As far as I can tell, ""the community"" is very open to different ideas, and if you're promoting and encouraging people to use services that do not comply with such regulations, your message would be extremely well accepted and praised.

&gt; What are we becoming?

""We"" are not one single, fixed entity with one mind and one narrative - even if one could say that everyone here agrees that privacy is extremely (if not the most) important. I for one don't necessarily enjoy seeing so much effort being put into how to present Monero in a way that pleases regulators, but at the same time I'm not naive enough to say it's useless or that it has no impact on how to increase awareness of the project as a whole. ""We"" are free to pursue different things, and you're a well known and very appreciated member of this community who has a different opinion on this, and you're free to promote and encourage people to use decentralized services. And as I mentioned, I'm sure the message would be well received too.

That being said, I think it might be important to make sure that these pro-regulation and pro-compliance stances are simply knowledgeable people about the project creating documentation and showing how Monero in fact does comply with current requirements, as it's very similar to cash which is official money. If such stances become so important to the point of impacting the development of the project, as to what features go in or do not, then I'd be up in arms with you because the project would start to become corrupt. But I find this hard to happen, as this community is very resilient and smart people are keeping their eyes on how the development is progressing. 

So, yeah, it's whatever from my personal perspective. I see no harm in what they're doing and I can understand the positive aspects it might bring. I also can see from another perspective where this quench for pleasing regulators could affect the development of the project although I don't see it right now, and I don't think this will happen because people here are not that dumb.","[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

That's not what's happening. Exchanges are literally delisting Monero because of the regulatory risk; ComplyFirst shows them that they don't have to delist. They can list Monero and still be compliant.

Regulations aren't going away, and sticking our head in the sand and pretending they don't exist is going to get us nowhere.

At least with monero they won't be able to make a total tx-graph and -map of your entire history when you hand them over an address and a viewkey.

I just read their description, and its not clear (especially since I can't find a link to the whitepaper) whether eclipse attacks would be prevented. However, based on the description of how the notary process works, there would likely have to be a mechanism to stop accepting blocks if a notary hasn't signed in a while. This would halt the system if all notaries stopped (small risk), and only partially mitigate the eclipse attack.

Each node could make an authenticated direct connection to a notary node. This can be done without the dPoW system though, where there are trusted connections to prominent members of the community or miners.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21]"

But i disagree here:

1. Bitcoin was built to be light and to scale more than visa. The white paper section 9 i think, says that you don't need a full node but only a node that contains all the previous headers (ignoring the transactions). There would be full nodes of course, but most nodes would just ignore transactions happened 10 years ago. Now the developers say that doing that would reduce the security of it. I don't have the technical knowledge to judge if that's bullshit or an actual fact.  Satoshi also talked about making the blocks bigger at one point, unfortunately he didn't specify when.

2. Monero is awesome and my favorite coin when it comes to its features but there are problems with it too. Some times you want your payments to be public.

Payjoin is a recent Bitcoin privacy improvement in Bitcoin

payjoin is a new way to become very private onchain and reduce the UTXO set while doing so , its already in btcpay and bluewallet

https://blockstream.com/2020/04/16/en-bitcoin-privacy-improves-with-btcpay-servers-p2ep-implementation/

Privacy wallets in Bitcoin are improving daily and lightning wallets are extremely private and constantly in development

Bitcoin is about to get a very large privacy improvement with Taproot that already has 82% miner support 

https://taprootactivation.com/

Here is a presentation on how Taproot with signature aggregation can allow for UTXOs with untraceable swaps and indistinguishable payment channels. Taproot allows privacy txs to share the same anonymity set as regular onchain transactions thus eliminates the concerns with everyone forced to opt into a privacy Bitcoin wallet to have a larger anonymity set.

It's simple and stable design, its history and its network effect cannot be replicated which makes it resistant to inflation and security bugs and attacks on the network. This is similar to how Gold preserve its properties and doesn't decay over time.

People trust it will not decay or get destroyed years and decades from now.

Bitcoin is more scarce than Gold, more secure, more transportable, more censorship and confiscation resistant. And it's as hard money as Gold that's why it will capture that market

It's not something you fork every 6 months for a futile reason. You need the consensus of the whole network. I'm not going to risk my wealth on something that might break one day. I want something stable

&gt;If another asset has better perks, it has. Market will decide what it values and how much over time.

The perks of Monero doesn't qualify it to be a store of value. It's amazing for private transactions but inherently lacks everything Bitcoin has to be the world reserve asset.

Look at XMR/BTC chart , if you held from all time high you'd still be more than 80% down. Bitcoin on the other hand is back at its ATH.

The Market has decided already!

&gt;Store of value comes from if people will pay you the same purchasing power for the asset that you paid yourself

Not true, when Gold first was discovered it had probably little value but as people discovered how scarce it is, it kept appreciating in value until it became a stable store of value while other metals lost value compared to it

Seems to me you are only looking at the plus side.

On the minus side I personally see a damned slippery slope, with a potentially quite unhealthy moderation policy at the end of it; I really don't know how many users we have to ""save"" from the service in question to outweigh that.

Anyway, from all I see that user could be just one of those poor souls that got sucked in by their selective scamming: For them, as for many other people, it does work. Plus only about half of their posts are about the service, with the other half looking quite ""organic"", which does not exactly shoud ""Shill!"". Plus they posted last already a month ago, if I saw that correctly.

I turned my node off, implemented the blocklist and left it off for like 2h then turned it on again.

Used my Mobile Wallet to connect to my remote node after it was fully synced and been amazed how fast everything is since then.

I hope the fix will go out soon for everyone so that this gets avoided in the future !

&amp;#x200B;

I've implemented a crontab to download the blocklist once a day, you should mention this too maybe ?

&gt;Bitcoin, due to it's first-mover advantage and network effect, is essentially a gateway to other cryptocurrencies. It has further succeeded the test of time, to an extent. Monero's prosperity is arguably partly owed to Bitcoin's success. Evidently, the salient privacy issues reflect a fundamental flaw. However, I deem it myopic to reduce the discussion to technical specifications. Both have their advantages and drawbacks. Monero and Bitcoin can happily co-exist, as they are effectively complementary. Let's not create an 'us versus them' atmosphere in this subreddit.","[2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24]"

You're right, my bad. Though I hope that it didn't detract from my explanations that followed.

Just in case: I'm not accusing you as a nexo shill if I gave you that impression. It's just that I was questioning the certainty of the original poster in regards to the ""scam or no-scam"" judgement based on the identities being out in the open.
I think it would be shortsighted to take something like that as a surefire way to determine something as having a ""very low"" chance of being a scam.
Which shouldn't mean it therefore must have a high chance either.
I'm just refuting that jump in conclusion, without implying that it therefore has to be exactly the other way around.
It's more nuanced and should ideally be judged on a case-by-cases basis by everyone themselves.

So what I tried to add to the conversation was to show a less polarized perspective of judgement, that hopefully leads to less biased assessments.

&gt; With this, I've done my research, I tested the app out. So far, so good.

Fair enough! If your research has given you confidence in the app and you deemed it safe for your use, then there's nothing I would say against that. Now whether that's enough for someone else is another matter. They may or may not do their own research, they may or may not trust your word. Ideally they care enough to do their own research and, depending on their own needs and trust-levels etc. they might decide it's either worth their trust or it isn't.

why would you wanna sell your BTC ? why don't you wanna get a loan on it :-D  
but honestly, it is not likely that BTC would see 10K ever again, so maybe a 45% loan on compound, wouldn't really hurt (+COMP  farming incentives).

if i was you, I'd convert it into WBTC, put it on compound, get a USDC or DAI loan from compound, (check the average rates on defirate). and then either take the USDC and buy XMR with it.

however the downside will be that you'll have roughly 1.5x exposure to crypto, which is a double sided blade, in which case you can hedge with synthetix products also.","[2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 23]"

Ok, so you said earlier that the risk of an exit scam is very low, because the ""teams identities are all public and they partner with groups like Bitgo.

If they exit scammed, they would go to jail or have to flee to a 3rd world country.""

&amp;#x200B;

I only tried to counter the ""very low"" scam risk argument, by pointing out that having their identity tied to a project didn't stop people in the past to try and scam people.

I would therefore not judge any business a ""very low"" scam-risk based on those factors alone.

Instead of going into specifics about particular companies' scam-risk I wanted to point to the general principle that having one datapoint hint at something ""maybe"" being a scam is not immediately proof of that, nor is the opposite.

So you saying the risk is ""very low"" merely because of their identities being openly connected was what I was taking issue with.

But I didn't mean to say that therefore they (or any other business) ARE scammers. Just that the opposite can't simply be claimed by what you mentioned alone.

And yes, this applies to other businesses as well. That's why everyone has to do their own dilligence and decide for themselves what is an acceptable risk.

Be it Nexo or Kraken or their fiat bank, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very much for adoption, but because there are a lot of clever (and not so clever) scammers around, it pays to be careful and not think oneself safe because something merely ""looks"" legit.

Of course that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't trust anything then.

It's a spectrum and everyone has to decide what they deem risky or not based on their own research.

I wouldn't base my trust on someone else's claims, be it positive or negative claims about a business.","[1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23]"

Which makes me curious though: You say storing your money in XMR protects it from inflation. But that only works as long as XMR is rising in value compared to the fiat I put into it, right?

Let's say I convert $100 to 100 XMR (for simplicity's sake).

Let's also say that inflation reduces the buying power of the dollar by 1 each year.

That means in 5 years $100 would only be worth $95 dollars.

Now, assuming that the value of XMR has neither risen nor fallen compared to the dollar, if after 5 years I convert the 100 XMR back to $100, then those $100 would still only be worth $95, no?

So the only way for XMR to be a hedge against inflation is if its value compared to the dollar goes up.

Would you say that is correct?","[5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24]"

Part of the attack is the attacker trying to lessen the privacy of users. This has been discussed in the Breaking Monero series. Another part of the attack is to disrupt user experience by, for instance, erroneously reporting the target height, which is basically novel. 

&gt;but these things should have been built into the GUI.

The GUI already includes plenty of mitigations to curb their actions. However, including a centralized ban list would be counter to the decentralization atmosphere we are trying to pursue. I am fairly certain more mitigations will be included soon to fully curb the attack. 

&gt;I downloaded the banlist but still looking for where in the GUI those parameters should go.

I provided detailed steps in the other thread.

Look back at any major recession: every central bank (or federal reserve) tried to boost the economy through decreasing the interest rates. It worked every time. The money suddenly gets cheaper, spending and investing gets attaractive.

Now the world faces the recession again, except this time the rates are already zero.   How do you boost your economy this time? Easy. With negative interest rates. -&gt; banks charge you interest to keep cash with them, rather than paying you interest.

It means you got salary? You either spend/invest it and boost economy or you keep it on your account and slowly loose it due to neg. interest.

See the problem already? You obviously don't want to loose your hard earned so you just want to withdraw it as cash (cash = zero interest rates), and then you store it - the opposite of what the central bank wants you to do.

The recession is real, the negative rates are real too - get ready to kiss cash goodbye.

&gt; The Breaking Monero series may have a bit of an inconvenient title, but it excellently explains situations where privacy can be lessened and what kind of mitigations can be used. These kind of videos are extremely helpful for people that may encounter specific situations and are trying to essentially optimize their privacy. 

&gt; What would be the alternative? To sweep issues under the rug?^1 That may short-term be beneficial to the price (although I sincerely doubt it), but it would show a lack of integrity on the part of the team. A stellar team with high integrity is often something that attracts investors. Having issues out in the open also allows researchers to actively investigate them and propose solutions or improvements. Ultimately, it benefits Monero (by gradually improving privacy) as well as users. 

&gt;&gt;but so many other people just use it as FUD.

&gt;Over the last two years, I have barely seen anyone use it for FUD. Recently, however, it has been used often by a certain set of trolls, but those essentially belong to the same entity. To the untrained eye, they may appear as independent users though.

IMHO you severely overestimate the whole story. If you have a fully running and stable program like the Monero daemon and you know your way around the code, like this individual certainly does after forking Monero and making various changes, it's not that difficult to add some tracking to it.

And mind you, you don't need real results. You don't need to get evidence that could get used in a court, or get people into hot waters because of tax evasion. You just want to make a stink. Collateral damage from wrong tracking results is acceptable to a high degree.

Not sure if those specific bytes always come before the password, but they were in two different tests I made. Plus I practiced. Using the findstr command (the Windows grep equivalent) probably would've been faster.

Coinbase) ..would coinbase be able to tell that you swapped monero for bitcoin?

So, let's look at the worst case. You use a service like xmr.to that ONLY swaps xmr --&gt; btc. Without having looked into the details of how xmr.to handles transactions, I'm going to say there's a *very* good chance that Coinbase could identify that the BTC came from xmr.to, which automatically implies it was gained by swapping Monero, since xmr.to doesn't offer anything else. Other instant-exchangers publish a list of recent swaps which could easily be scrapped.

But what if the service handles multiple currencies that don't openly publish recent swaps? Something like MorphToken handles like 5 currencies and swaps two ways between all of them. So even if they see that your BTC came from MorphToken, they don't automatically know you swapped XMR for it. Still, cross-chain analysis is a thing. Chain analysis companies will look for say a $100 Transaction to an exchange in, say ETH, and if they see a corresponding $100 transaction coming *from* the same exchange, say to BTC, they could make an inference that there was a chain hop. When doing this analysis with Monero, they can't see the Monero going to the exchange, *but* they could see a lack of any of the transparent assets going to the exchange, and still make an inference. You can see though, the inferences are already starting to get dicier.

So far I've been talking about instant exchanges, which are pretty bad for causing time-correlation attack opportunities, since the incoming and outgoing transactions happen effectively simultaneously. However, if you were to send to a more traditional non-KYC exchange like TradeOgre, let your funds rest in that account for a minute, *then* withdraw to BTC, you make those timing attacks effectively impossible. At that point, all they really know is what exchange the coins came from. To link it to an XMR transaction, you'd most likely need the other exchange to share data to make the link. I say most likely because perhaps there are avenues I haven't thought of.

There are other ways to exchange XMR --&gt; BTC of course, but basically any attempt to reveal that link is (as far as I know) going to be some sort of timing attack.

&gt; And would they be able to find out where the monero you received originally came from?

I don't see how coinbase would be able to figure that out without other data sources, like if the Monero you received were sent from an exchange, the exchange would know about that TX. I would probably move the funds to a different wallet before swapping personally, just in case.

The bigger risk to swapping XMR for BTC imo is the risk that you obtain tainted coins. For that reason, I'd stay away from more P2P trading solutions like Bisq or localmonero.co. When you're receiving bitcoin, you really don't know the history of the coins you're about to receive and that's a real risk. Best to use a ""clean"" exchange like Kraken or Kucoin IMO. Since XMR is private, you really don't have to worry so much about where your XMR might have been, even when sending to more regulated exchanges. That's what makes it so great!","[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

THANK YOU!!! UPVOTE PLEASE!!

**MY STORY OF BEING SCAMMED BY FREEWALLET:**

FREEWALLET is holding 350+ XMR of mine hostage, and are unwilling to release it! It has been OVER 2 months now! (Yes I know I now about ""Not your keys not your wallet"")

Unfortunately my XMR wallet was malfunctioning(one of my CAKE wallets), and still is regardless of how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled it(white screen with error messages) so I searched for another wallet, and FREEWALLET was at top.

Here is where I made the mistake, since I was in a rush (LESSON LEARNED I PROMISE).

I didn't even realize what i had done until it was too late. **I had sent tens of thousands of dollars to a CUSTODIAL WALLET!!!!**

They gladly accepted my donation, but I immediately tried to send the funds out, after realizing, and was flagged for ""SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY"" So let me get this straight taking my funds BACK into my control is SUSPICIOUS??? (What a bunch of SCAMMERS)

Ive provided them:

**Photo ID**

**Screenshots of wallet the transactions came from**

**Ring signatures,**

**Proof of residence,**

**Pictures of me in front of computer with sending wallet open and a ridiculous pic they sent.**

**After sending them this, they then asked where the funds came from, and it was another wallet I had which I also sent them DETAILED info from!!** (They keep asking questions until they find something that you cannot comply with then this somehow gives them justification to STEAL YOUR FUNDS)

**At each step they assured me that this is the ""LAST THING OUR SECURITY DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO COMPLETE VERIFICATION""**

I have provided them everything short of a **STOOL SAMPLE,** which I'm gladly able and willing to send if they provide a valid address... you know just so they can verify that the funds are mine...

I have asked them for their ADDRESS Their NAMES and of course they will not comply!

I noticed that They tend to PLAY A GAME WITH YOU BY ASKING FOR THE SAME INFORMATION 3-5 TIMES (Most likely to delay the process and have more time with your funds)

&gt;**As far as I can tell I am the ONLY person they have held funds for over 2 months!So those asking if FREEWALLET IS A SCAM?**

**ABSOLUTELY!! FREEWALLET IS A SCAM!!**

I have never in my almost 10 years of crypto witnessed anything like this, or had funds held without any justification, for such a long time!

Most recently they are asking me:

&gt;**"" please provide us with a photo of the certified purchase agreement containing the buyer's and seller's IDs. The document should also contain transaction hashes, addresses and amount.""**

This Monero came from MANY transactions, mostly cash, done over the course of years with people I meet in Meetups and Crypto Conferences (I'm very involved with Crypto, and yes I should have known better)

Impossible to provide this information even if I wanted to!!

How dare they ask for ID of a person that I purchased coins from?

Like anyone would be willing to provide their personal information to a SCAM WEBSITE, or me?

And what does any of this have to do with verification? I sent them Ring signatures that CONFIRM that the funds came from me. NO ONE else in the whole world would have access to this information!!

I hope that others can learn from my mistake, and avoid #FREEWALLET like the plague!!If you read this Please tell others you may encounter about this SCAM so that they are not effected!

I believe that if the community STANDS up against these SCAMMERS, together we can take them down, or at least limit the number of people that they effect!!

**I am working on a website that will detail all of my ordeals with them and a place where others can go to post details of their negative encounters with freewallet, since they buy positive reviews to offset the negative ones, I mean they made enough $$ from me alone to buy several thousand positive reviews! (its easy to tell the fake reviews they usualy one line and talk about the ""great User Interface"" also the accounts have 3 names like"" Jose Louis Gonzales"" whereas the negative reviews are detailed and only have first and last names!**

**If you have been scammed by FREEWALLET SCAM please CONTACT ME!(Hope I used ""SCAM"" enough times also ""SELECTIVE SCAMMING"")**

**#Freewalletscam #Freewalletisascam**

Interesting article Perfect example of SELECTIVE SCAMMING, as soon as the article was published bringing FREEWALLET SCAM into light, they quickly ""CLEAR"" up the mistake!

However, with enough CPU power yo can still buy a 51+% mining pool. Just running nodes is probably even cheaper, since nodes don't necessarily need to do mining.

I don't think code contribution metrics are necessarily a worry. They also don't give a reasonable picture of the community. On the other hand, the inverse argument can also be true: why does Bitcoin need so many people contributing code to it all the time? It's more difficult to audit code that is mixed from significantly larger groups of people who don't necessarily have a shared understanding of the core. Determining an exact number that is just right for how many people should theoretically be contributing code is silly. Fewer people who are domain experts can often produce much better code than a bunch of random people contributing random things. Calling it a ""weakness"" just seems like grasping at straws. Maybe they should be contributing code instead of trying to count contributors.

For user experience, it's more than just having a pretty interface and obvious send/receive buttons. The locked/available balance and having to wait 20 minutes for things to sync up, for example is a point of contention for users. Just go look through the Monero subreddits/telegrams/IRC/whatevers and fine all the ""help my balance is 0"" and such threads. The need to back up the seed phrase is also something that's akin to skipping through an EULA when installing software. People just skip over it and want to use the wallet as quickly as possible, and then get upset whey they didn't back it up. Having to wait until all blocks are synced to know the balance is also discomforting, as it can sometimes be slow. Then there's the official GUI wallet, which for ""simple"" mode just runs a node rather than using remote node. Then people get upset of course because it just took up 100GB of disk and maybe breached their data cap. There's probably some other things that could use improvement here too, but these are the ones off the top of my head.","[2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

250 Hs/s @ 2 GHz per thread (I think it´s underestimate as my old G3900 @ 2.8 GHz makes about 400 Hs/s).

A blockchain is decentralized, yet still somehow manages to reach consensus. When a disagreement occurs (chain fork), the fork with the most (proof of) work wins.

The same is true for the code - whoever puts in the most work wins.

Really? I've never seen devs dictate rules over community consensus the past few years I've been following Monero. And I swear Monero users are much more active and knowledgeable than the average crypto users, this can be seen from things like amount of full nodes and number of community members with technical or other skills contributing to Monero or the ecosystem. Even on the more contentious issues where some people had significant financial interests (PoW algo) there was never a majority that opposed the devs. I feel like even the minority that complained was well heard and ultimately everyone agreed not to continue with frequent PoW algo tweaks.

With the introduction of RandomX, if we adjust for hash rate Monero is probably the most decentralized project out there. It's ultimately the users who choose the fork they feel serves them best, like Monero was chosen over Bytecoin, and it seems disingenuous to suggest otherwise.

however, that's where the trail goes full cold.  if you withdrew to your personal wallet *[address]* before sending anywhere else, they have no reason to say that *[address]* was illicit. they have no knowledge of how much other balance that *[address]* has.  they have no idea where *[address]* sent to, how much it sent, or if it ever moved those xmr at all.  

Whether or not this is a concern depends on your level of opsec.  In my jurisdiction of the US, it would likely be insufficient evidence for a proving guilt to simply say that you bought xmr.  Buying xmr is not illegal.  

In a strict opsec comparison to buying thru KYC vs non-KYC, non-KYC is always the winner.  But it would be a little disingenuous to imply that the KYC pathways expose you to any real vulnerability.

&gt;is there a way to buy XMR with cc without kyc?

I've heard about bisq &amp; localmonero for this.  although my preferred path is to just buy LTC on coinbase, and then send it to morphtoken.  From a surveillance perspective, all they'd know is that I bought litecoin and sent it, but I'm separated from the blockchain after the swap.  Perhaps they'd know that the address I sent LTC to was owned by morph's LTC wallet, but they wouldn't know what was changed to.  Maybe they could also subpoena morph to try to get the logs from them, but still after all that, they'd only be able to prove that I own monero.  Which again is not a crime or proof of wrongdoing.

The same thing happens with CPUs. There is an excess of powerful CPUs, so it's cheaper for manufacturers to stick overkill CPUs in products that don't need it at all. [Check this guy out playing Doom on his blender, and it runs well.](https://v.redd.it/6rhpohtrg3331)

On a transparent chain, you will end up with a complex mess of tainted coins, international sanctions, and geopolitical power struggles. Government miners can form international coalitions and orphan blocks mined by small states. The could easily blacklist transactions from an entire nation and cut them off from the global economy. It doesn't happen now because miners are economically motivated. Government franchises aren't subject to free market conditions, and wouldn't think twice about pouring gigawatts of energy into unproductive hostile mining behaviour. Profit motive precludes the private sector from behaving this way.

A hash war could be extremely disruptive to the network. Hostilities such as cyber warfare or cruise missile attacks against data centres are completely within the scope of attacks nations states are willing to engage in.

Basically, it would require tweaking whatever mining algo we want to use by adding one extra operation at the end: signing the block hash with the private key of the address that is meant to receive the block reward.

Since you would have to generate this signature for each and every nonce you try, this would put an astronomical load on any mining pool (both in terms of compute power and bandwidth/latency).

Obviously the pool would not want to expose their private key to all its miners (since anyone could try stealing the block rewar after it is found), so pool mining would become pretty much impossible.

The huge downside is that this would force everyone to solo-mine. Counter-intuitively, this would actually be bad: only large mining operations would be able to bear the risk and varianc of solo-mining, while the army of small and medium miners supporting the network would spend most of its time waiting for months/years between blocks found - eventually driving them out and reducing the total hashrate of the network, making it less secure.","[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

Monero uses Dandelion++. Dndelion works by randomly diffusing transaction broadcasts. So for a Sybil attack to link a tx to a node's IP address it has to be intercepted at the first node of a Dandelio broadcast. 

This isn't a silver bullet but helps any way. 

The best mitigation for this attack maybe is to use Tor or i2p. 

If you wanna use Tor on your O.S, you can just install Tor from debian repository 

# apt install apt-transport-tor

Then you need to add the following entries to /etc/apt/sources.list or a new file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/:

deb tor://sdscoq7snqtznauu.onion/torproject.org &lt;DISTRIBUTION&gt; main

You can find more information [here](https://support.torproject.org/es/apt/)

Run the service

 # systemctl start tor 

Use the flag --tx-proxy tor,127.0.0.1:9050 when you run monerod

With that flag txs will broadcasting over Tor (AFAIK)

You can check the Tor connectios if you type in the Terminal (After run Monerod, in the same console) 

""print_cn""

You can also connect to your Node from external conecction Over Tor ussing Hidden Services.

Either way, without massive adoption or without simple and abundant links to fiat, market value will never keep up with some others crypto's. One could argue Monero doesn't need enormous market values as long as one can make his anonymous tx (reasonable amounts of it).   

I hope atomic swaps will work soon (or in 'time'). I hope Monero will be pegged to other chains like ethereum and polkadot and that Monero will enter the world of Dex's and DeFi. This would be a good thing for adoption, but won't help in opening doors to the traditional fin system.

Correct me if I'm wrong:

The reason we would rather have perfectly hidden amounts rather than perfectly bound commitments (since at present you can only choose 1) is that if it starts to look like the quantum boogeyman reality is coming true, we can switch over to a new scheme beforehand and then the transaction amounts would remain private, even after the rise of the quantum computers.

Whereas if we used perfectly bound commitments, then a quantum computer would be able to retroactively solve for the amounts of every Monero transaction.

So in short, if it appears that quantum computers are getting close to being able to break the Discrete Log Problem, as long as we migrate to a new scheme *before* that happens, everything is completely safe - no inflation, and even the transaction amounts from transactions that were made with the old scheme remain private.","[2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23]"

In a world where Monero scaled well and became used by a substantial portion of the globe as their primary currency (say 10%), it would trigger a positive feedback loop.

The people who saved and transacted in Monero would be richer and freer than people who did not, which would make more people want to use it, and so on.

They would be richer because their savings would not be eaten away by inflation. They would also be richer because it would be so easy to do cash-in-hand jobs, so more people would avoid taxes out of sheer convenience, even if they had no ideological opposition to paying them.

The government could not make up its tax revenue shortfall (at least, not as much) by inflating fiat for the remaining fiat users, because this would just create more incentive for those people to embrace Monero, further stripping away the government's power.

Due to lost revenue, the government would have to engage in less warfare with other governments, saving many innocent lives and preventing the destruction of much accumulated wealth. This would make all of society richer, with more capital goods available for investing in production, reducing global poverty.

The government would also be less able to intervene in the economy, picking winners and losers, distorting production and keeping us from generating wealth. This too would help alleviate poverty.

The world would still be far from perfect, but it would be a much better world if Monero became popular and radically undermined the government's most potent and subtle tool for enslaving people: fiat money.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23]"

A low price is indicative of low demand and low usage.
A low price would aid in government control, but they would be controlling less and less.
There is a near perfect correlation between network sizes and the amount a network is worth.

Controling a small crypto it still valuable for a government.

Money laundering can be made on small network as well therefore control will be in government direct interest too.

&gt;	I also disagree with your game theory assessment because I don’t see you considering that an altruistic majority orphaning blocks back causes massive mining losses for the attacker side of the chain.

You said it yourself “altruistic” mean they would act at a loss.

And the attacker is not having a massive loss, just the regular block rewards compare to the honest chain that gain the block rewards and loose the extra rewards. 

One strategy get more gain (compliance: block rewards + extra rewards) the altruistic will have less gain (only block rewards) and both loose the same if fail. Exactly an example of game theory advantage.

&gt;	Miners would essentially maintain a soft-fork until the other entity plays along, or goes through the work to fully hard-fork off.

For that you would need much more 51% of hash power to not only not try to get the block rewards but also spend energy orphaning the block that got rewards.

Not realistic, 

&gt;	On top of that, the incentive system would need to be submitted as a transaction. That means that after it’s paid out, the blocks could be rewound and submitted legitimately with the government payment validly spent so the hypothetical government would have spent an entire 3 or 4 block reward for no effect on the chain.

If the block the government paid rewards in it get orphaned, government get full refund **they would loose nothing** 

Attacking such block would allow the government to get the full rewards back to pay again the next miner willing to comply.

&gt;	In either case, altruistic miners teaming up essentially ignore a minority group of hash power and have far less hash competition.

You assume a majority of miner are willing to give up on extra and event attack block at huge expense just to not include a tx in a block.

This unrealistic IMO.

Much more likely such high rewards (let’s images a 1.000.000$ rewards) will actually get every single pool/miner to take every opportunity they can to get it.

&gt;	There are so many profitable vectors to get altruistic retribution against a misbehaving entity.

Nobody will be willing to risk including such tx as the block will be pretty much guaranteed to be orphaned.

&gt;Except that it then becomes more profitable if the rest of the network teams up to orphan blocks from an entity that is routinely orphaning valid blocks.

Obviously the government would also offer rewards to the child blocks to ensure the change remain permanent.

For example: 100.000$ for the block that successfully orphan the illegal block and 30.000 for the block that mine on top of that chain and say 10.000 for the third blocks.

With such scheme the government ensure no « counter orphan » can happen.


&gt;If a government is paying 20% of the hash power to orphan legal blocks and the rest of the network doesn't like that, the rest of the network could agree to orphan those blocks back and guess what... all of those miners are making 20% more because they're not listening to blocks from these entities now.

No if they ignore the rewards they loss, it is not in their interest to be ideological in this scheme, they would be quick outcompete by compliant miner. Game theory is on the side of compliance.


&gt;I would argue it is cheap and well within any government budget (and this is taking 1/4 block rewards basis, I think less can still be effective)
I would argue it's the exact opposite. it would cost 70m / year to potentially have a tentative grasp on a transaction market that accounts for maybe .05% of global transactions (and that's if you're making some really generous assumptions about global trade.)

Look at how much government spend on the war on drug.. 70m to block crypto money laundering is peanuts.



&gt;Also remember Metcalf's law. If Bitcoin begins to represent substantially more of global transactions, the price is going to be substantially higher and the required bribe to omit transactions is also going to be substantially higher.
This is why a bounty model over BTC would never be cheap.

Government have infinite money.

And well if they choose the bounty scheme it might even cost them zero to force the network into compliance.

They will only have to the rewards some time to time.. likely very rarely.



&gt;Government dont have to buy all at once (obviously)
They can just buy only the rewards money as they spend it, that would result in a net zero in BTC demand.
The government would still be another bidder for any block reward money. That specifically means demand would go up.

They would spend it back to block rewards immediately.. it can be done without increasing BTC price, easy even at today liquidity.



&gt;Hell - even if the government is mining, it means that there are fewer BTC are in circulation so the price rises due to supply decreases.
And that doesn't even dive into the cost of the constant cycle of hardware they would need to buy to mine.

No very unlikely any government will ever mine once they will have understand how to use incentives to control the network.



&gt;While I'm not 100% sure the BTC network will continue to grow in the way that it has, if it does overcome outstanding scaling issues, the government investment of 5.2B in BTC alone could turn it into the wealthiest nation on earth by a wide margin over the span of 60 years.

No 5.2B investment is necessary for that scheme, actually if done well no investment is necessary at all.

Honestly the bounty scheme (pay to orphan) is much more likely because it would be so cheap.

&gt;Even at a fraction of that, I'm 100% sure that the governments priorities would change from ""let's censor these transactions over here"" to ""damn most of our net worth is now in BTC - I want to do everything possible to make BTC increase in value more.""

""damn most of our net worth is now in BTC - I want to do everything possible to make BTC increase in value more.""

That doesn’t exclude control, and government love control.

&gt;It absolutely is if you expect the transaction volume to increase on the network.
""Now"" has almost always been the best time to buy any crypto.

No government can buy exactly the amount they are willing to pay and immediately pay back the rewards.

Net zero.



&gt;And what I'm saying is if somehow we reach 25% of transactions on BTC, the price per coin will be unfathomably large.
Even assuming BTC is overvalued by around double, Metcalf's law would suggest the BTC price-point hover around $2b per coin if network usage reaches 25% of current global.

&gt;Hell, even if you make a much more conservative estimate and settle on network value being dictated more by Dijkstra's algorithm, we're still talking a price in the $150M per coin range.
I have several reasons to believe BTC won't reach that level of saturation, but any open crypto network that obtains that level of usage is going to be prohibitively costly to censor

This is highly speculative, 

And really If BTC need a 150M$ to be transactions censorship resistant the project is doomed.

Gold is fungible and not transparent, Maximalists keep saying BTC is the new gold like mantra after BTC failed as cryptoCURRENCY but unfortunately it failed as gold as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the governments decide to ban cryptos, can BTC survive? Almost certainly not, because it’s trackable. Can XMR survive? Maybe, but not certainly. But, out of all the cryptos, it seems like the most likely to survive a crypto ban.

The only way to ban XMR would be to shutdown the whole Internet and even then we could create own network of computers. BTC is easier to control as of now as the power is centralized.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;CDBCs, if introduced, will almost certainly be private but have backdoors for law enforcement (just like banking today). If such CDBC starts to get used will BTC survive? Will XMR survive? I do think XMR will survive for the illegal stuff.

I think this was the case with BTC for most of its history.

The spending power of BTC during the 50BTC reward era started at a $0USD reward per block and ended at $500 USD and had an absolute peak in the $1600 USD range.

The spending power of BTC during the 25BTC reward era started at $250, ended around $17500 and had an absolute peak around $28,750.

The spending power of BTC during the 12.5BTC era started at $8750, ended around $118,000 and had an absolute peak around $250,000 mark.

The hashrate has followed that trend as well.

If anything, it's getting more expensive for a government to give rewards for censoring transactions.

The *only* way they could do that would be to buy up massive swaths of BTC to use as a reward as early as possible.

So let's say a government wanted to issue a reward from here out that is 1/4th of the BTC reward for censoring transactions.

To censor a transaction for the next 60 years starting at the beginning of the next (3.125) epoch you would need around 325,000 BTC.

Let's save them some money and buy that BTC today because there's no evidence of that price going lower.

So OTC transaction for $5.2 billion worth of transactions, done.

Now that government is among the largest few holders of BTC.

On top of that, said governments would have to *publically announce* the reward program.

The mere announcement of a censorship program would begin the process of undermining that government's own massive investment.

They would still be shooting themselves in the foot.

Even if it were technically easy to execute these swaps, and there was enough liquidity (and low enough volatiilty) that users felt they could quickly get a reasonable price in a reasonable amount of time, and that they could get back into BTC, there are a few big barriers:

1. You have to be running your own Bitcoin node; doing a ""swap"" on a centralized service is just doing a trade, which has been possible for years and not done much for Bitcoin's fungibility.
2. You have to be running a Monero node, which is even more of a barrier
3. You have to know about Monero (sorry)
4. The user has to choose to do this. In general, voluntary privacy mechanisms, especially those that cost extra tranasction fee, have very little uptake beyond political idealists.

These things mean that BTC XMR swaps are not going to be a super widespread thing. It's reasonable to hope that they'll improve Bitcoin's privacy enough to eliminate the sort of automated taint-tracing that exists in Bitcoin today, since it'll trigger so many false positives.

As I said above and in some other comments, it would be more effective for government to directly use miner incentives.

Government can pay extra rewards to all block mined that fit their blacklist and maybe pay a bounty to orphan block that would try to include the blacklisted tx.

Many countries can follow the same strategy, Blacklist being fundamentaly compatible with each other, pool will have incentives to enforce as many blacklist as possible to maximize rewards.

It would be cheaper and most effective (worldwide effect, immediate, no need for investigation or law enforcement help) that trying to enforce law to a decentralized, worldwide network.

And Bitcoin block rewards is reducing fast, it will get cheaper and cheap to apply this strategy.

Also maybe with Taproot and so on you can actually hide the fact that this is an atomic swap. And so then each transaction adds to the reasonable doubt that this could be an atomic swap.

However, by integrating it in major wallets, the Bitcoin Cash  ecosystem can enjoy a practical and user-friendly privacy tool that will  increase usage and adoption. This will also lead to a growing anonymity  set, which may be the most important factor in any system.

&gt;On his website he claims to have presented his concerns within the community but was banned as a result. 

That is simply false, see:

&gt;What's the point? Do you think there is anything sane about fireice's actions? He has a clear obsessive disorder which drives his actions. Nothing of what you say or do will ever stop him from manipulating words for his own gains and act as maliciously as possible. **Let's remember that guy was banned from here for hiring shills to spam the subreddit.** He is very much aware of that, but publicly he says he was banned for exposing vulnerabilities in Monero. Publicly stating such easily verifiable lie should make you understand how low is the level of the situation.

&gt;If you criticise his actions, you are a Monero community member who hates him because of reasons. There is no discussion with him, he built up is own world where he is the light of reason and any despicable action is excused, because it's for fighting the real enemy: The cult of the Monero community. He will just drag you down with him.

&gt;Instead of risking of giving him a stage, the best thing to do is to expose is actions, explain why he is bullshit and then go on with your life. A stage is what he wants and need to keep going.

Indeed.

&gt; It would really help if the layout of the tx extra field was formalised with a simple 'record type field'

Well it is *somewhat* formalized already as the wallet/daemon use *tagged* data in the field and anyone can *extend* that to other uses should they so desire - without needing to patch Monero itself. Furthermore, data can already be embedded in transactions in other ways as well, e.g. fake output keys or data in the proofs. Thus discussion around any removal / changing of tx.extra is a slightly nuanced one; the tx format would have to change to accommodate what's already using tx.extra (e.g. the tx pub key still needs embedding *somewhere* in the tx), but also consideration of the known (i.e. merge-mining) and unknown (?) things people may need in the future.

When one is speaking of formalization, we need to be clear on distinctions of what is enforced at the protocol (i.e. enforced / verified by peers) vs what is informal (i.e. how it currently is) vs how it can be defined to parse.

For example:

&gt; Reserve the first 4096 values for things defined by the Monero core team, and make the rest of the values a free for all, where other developers can impose their own validation on the extra data

Is this enforced? because if it is, that potentially means more parsing  / verification time which potentially means slower sync time. If it's *not* enforced, it's basically what we have now (a few defined tags with defined purposes and anything else is fair-game).

At the end of the day we want our cake and to eat it! We want txs to all *look* the same but we also want to allow (or rather to continue to allow) things like merged-mining. We want more structure to tx.extra but we don't want the expense of validating (or additional parsing even).

There have been several ideas floated and even a couple of related PRs (one for simpler MM support and another for quantized size encrypted data spring to mind), but nothing is really agreed upon yet as to the best course of action, if any, should be taken.","[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20]"

This is a double edged sword, a game that anyone can play.  *Somebody* could do a little disinformation campaign here.

Ask yourself: ""*What Would the CIA Do?*"" 🤔 I think they would poison this well with lies.

Let's pretend you run a crypto exchange (or maybe a Bitcoin mixer site) and you also run, or know the admin of some illegal website (gambling, marketplace, etc.)  Specifics don't matter to this concept.  You could purposely route legitimate Bitcoins through known (or soon to be known) illegal blacklisted wallets just to poison this well.  Cast suspicion on many unsuspecting Bitcoin users.  Make it nearly impossible to know who has committed a ""crime"" and who just got dirty Bitcoins from the mixer man.  I bet this would be a great way to destabilize Bitcoin's dominance.

Maybe collusion between a Bitcoin mining pool and an illegal website: an agreement to mix coins with each other just for fun.  *Why not?*  Maybe sellers on local Bitcoins decide to run their coins through some ""illegal"" website, just for the fun of it.  Somebody could setup a website where people can knowingly poison the future of their Bitcoins by depositing them into a mixer site that purposely runs them through some ""illegal"" wallets that haven't been discovered yet.  *Why not?*  It's all fun and games until the surveillance state is so overcome with disinformation that they crumble under the pressure of their own paranoia.

This is dangerous.  It could severely hurt the concept behind all cryptocoins and cultivate public distrust in decentralized currencies.  Maybe this is what the government plans to do.  Why outlaw Bitcoin when you can fabricate evidence of illegal activity and arrest anyone who uses it?  If you outlaw it, people will be angry.  If you fabricate evidence of illegal activity and use that to arrest anyone who uses it, then the public perception will change into thinking of Bitcoin users as criminals.  Kind of like how the government criminalized drug use and poisoned the minds of the public into believing that ""*drugs are bad*.""  Well... ""*Bitcoin is bad*"" folks.

Not a problem, just exclude as many tx from as many countries as you can to collect the most rewards.

Miner that obey the most blacklists will get the most rewards.

Imagine:

China, US, venezuela, UK, Germany all give 1 BTC for compliance.

If your block exclude all tx from all the said country blacklist you collect 5 Btc..

A country can even increase the rewards 10x or 100x if you produce a block that orphan a block with a transaction the said country considers illegal.

That would mean you can collect 14 BTC if you attack a block with an illegal tx included.

Which miner would be crazy enough to try to mine a « free block » in those conditions?

And don’t forget, Bitcoin block rewards is set to disappear.. the lowest the block rewards the easiest it will be to corrupt Bitcoin mining incentives.

It might become immensely more profitable to comply and nearly impossible to get a « free » block in the chain.

&gt;	there would also be additional costs derived from this, and this would make mining bitcoin even more expensive,

The cost of such systems is absolutely negligible and paid back by compliance.


&gt;	You could also use lighting network or bridges to ethereum or other protocols to wrap it etc.

Some payment channel might mitigate such phenomenon but it actually increases the Bitcoin fungibility crisis..

Giving coin onchain and coin on LN very different characteristics... the very opposite of the definition of fungible.

&gt;	they will always be one step behind.

There is an incentive. As soon as a group of miners has 51%, they can just orphan everyone else's blocks and reap 100% of network emission rewards.

In reality, that should actually be pretty terrifying. Not for Monero, but for Bitcoin. Ok, Monero might have a few edge cases where an output might be known, and some hypothetical censorship could happen if somehow you can actually convince the pool operators to collude.

Thanks for the links.

You can put NordVPN to the test by first subscribing to its services using your debit/credit card and within the next 48 hours, you reach out to them, telling them you wish to have your money back.

If you feel bad, you can ask for a pro-rated refund excluding the two days that you used NordVPN's services.

However the most important thing is to ask them for the address of their payment processing center. It was in Florida, USA, last year.

1) Copy/pasting or saving your seed as a text file on a computer, especially from a hardware wallet, is largely defeating the purpose of having cold storage! The seed must *never* touch an internet-connected device or device that may become internet-connected, even briefly. Doing this subjects your seed to clipboard, keystroke, or screenshot capture malware, and possible plaintext copies of the file if the user screws this up.

2) The uniqueness (complication) of printing out Winrar hex works against you when it comes to robustness and reversing the process. First, this method would have to be tested in recovery to make sure nothing went wrong during creation of the backup (true for all backup strategies)--again on an isolated PC. Second, the password has to be remembered or stored separately (no advantage or disadvantage here). Third, data integrity post testing may be harder to determine (such as if the printout required two pages and one page is lost or in the difficulty of correctly transcribing the hex back into a file without errors).

3) All you are hoping to accomplish and more can be done with directly writing down hardware wallet 24-word seeds. Data integrity (dictionary words) is much easier to verify, the seeds are smaller, they can be stored on fire- and water-resistant metal backup products, and you never expose it to an internet-connected device.

For encryption of the backup, you can use hardware wallet passphrases on top of the 24-word seed. Same tradeoffs in needing to remember or backup the passphrase, but without the other complexity. These methods are also better documented and supported across the industry (what if Winrar has a bug or becomes an obsolete format?).","[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24]"

But the early parts of the document lay the roadmap for milestones and projected timeframe of each.  AFAIK we’re a couple weeks into the 12 week deadline so hopefully good pacing. 

That being said, the plan is to have a swap client that is bundled with the monero package but it would be a separate daemon, apart from the wallet &amp; monerod.  There may even be multiple swap clients and daemons needed.  

The 12-week working deliverable will be cli only but if all goes well then it will likely get integrated in GUI eventually.  It’s also outside the scope of the proposal to create a DEx for swappers to find each other, so we will be relying on other third party tools for that component.

I subscribed to NordVPN about a year ago. Do NOT use it because its payment processing center is in the USA despite it claiming to be based in Panama.

Obviously a good user experience is something we have to take into account and if people now setup a large amount of malicious remote nodes we will be forced to change the simple mode node scanner anyway.
