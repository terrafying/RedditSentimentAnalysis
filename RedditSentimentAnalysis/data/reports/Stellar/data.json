With the recent backlash against CMC after the Binance sale, Coingecko has the opportunity to be the main aggregating site, but the longer the page 1 rankings are manipulated to hide popular projects, I believe the more likely alternative aggregators will gain market share.

I appreciate running such a site is not straightforward, and projects try and manipulate their position with various nefarious tactics. However, one project in particular has a large, passionate community, and a finished product that is genuinely innovative, instead of the usual fork+false ""innovation"" tactics projects which Coingecko et al list on page 1. Continuing to hide this project from page 1 is a horrible mistake, and the longer it's not listed the more angry Coingecko users will be when they find out what they have missed out on. 

It's also been one of the best performing projects price wise of 2020, but people that use Coingecko for discovering projects have missed out on the gains. Why? Because Coingecko refuse to list the circulating supply, even though its an erc20 and is listed correctly by other aggregators like Coinpaprika and Nomics. 

Like I said I know running an aggregator site is not easy, but in this case Coingecko is clearly making a horrible mistake. Please reconsider your decision.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23]"

I don't know what the word for it would even be... not really DCA'ing since it's based on hitting specific targets, not selling at time increments.

How would you determine what percentages you take out at which price points? Is it pretty much arbitrary / personal preference or is there a proven strategy?

How do you balance locking in profits, vs taking so much off the table that you regret it if the coin continues to explode upwards?

Say if you bought BTC today for $11.5k and your goal is for it to hit 60k. Would you start taking some profit once it's gone up 25%? 50%?

Most what you mention are a bit strange. The ASIC for RandomX mining algo is the best CPU in existence. Such CPUs are usually available in closest computer store all over the world.  Botnets can mine Monero or can do some other very bad things elsewhere. So mining Monero sounds quite good use of them. They secure network well. But sadly not that many mine it.  

Bugs can happen to any coin. Inflation bug in Bitcoin was abused once, in Monero was not. Only way for such bugs not to happen is to audit all code. Monero does that and spends vast amounts of money that is collected by random donators for auditing all code that researchers do.  

Updates happens only when you have something to update. In first 6 years was plenty. Sooner or latter that will reduce to very rare or to none at all.  The consensus or the Boss is that updates makes transactions smaller and faster or ledger more opaque.  Of course only when code of such updates is audited by several companies.  If triptych will show it is in Monero consensus or Monero Boss spirit then will be added to Monero protocol in 2021 or 2022.  If not will be just research that some other coins or something else can use.

It seems you have no idea what you're talking about, again.

When using credit cards, you give the other party PERMISSION to charge you whatever they want, ANYTIME, and they have your info FOREVER.
With Bitcoin on the other hand, it's a ""PUSH"" transaction, YOU decide how much and when to send it.
If you use a 3rd party that deals with your funds he will be holding the funds for a month before transferring them to the merchant(like with credit cards) and you will be paying fees for that.

Bitcoin already scales to layer-2 with the Lightning Network which allows instant and unfairly cheap transaction, you should read about it, or even better, try it yourself.(It takes under 60 seconds to pay and load a gift card to Amazon).

And according to you, there are ~300,000 daily fraudulent transaction on Bitcoin. Seriously, where did you get that number?

&gt; is crypto still worth it?

Popular opinion seems to be that we're about to enter a bull market. If you just buy bitcoin today and hold for a year, there's a good chance you'll double your money or more. Personally I've been out of it for about 3 years and just getting back in right now because it looks very promising

&gt;Which one? 

Look on https://coinmarketcap.com/ , research coins in the top 30 or so, and pick a few that you like or sound promising.

BTC/ETH are probably your safest bets. Then you get into stuff like Chainlink or Cardano that are more risky, but a higher chance of 10x-ing your investment. The lower down the list you go, generally the more risky it gets. Past the top 100 coins you're basically gambling or buying penny stocks. Arguably way higher up the list than that even.

&gt; What's the initial investment needed? 

As little as like $10 I guess? To start with, you probably want 0 - 5% of your current savings in crypto. It's still a risky speculative asset.

To me, the idea of putting $10 or even $100 into crypto doesn't really seem worth it. You put $10 into a coin and it increases in value 10x... cool, now you have $100, is that really significant to you? 

Personally I try to find the sweet spot between where if I lost all the money I invested, I wouldn't really miss it or lose sleep over it. But still enough that it would be a sizeable chunk of money for me if it went up 5x or 10x.

&gt; What about it being stolen?

From most to least safe: Buy a hardware wallet or create a paper wallet and put it in a safe or safety deposit box, create a wallet on your computer or phone and make sure the device is password-protected ideally with 2FA, leave on a reputable exchange.

If you follow basic safety and don't do anything too dumb, the risk of getting scammed or having your crypto stolen is quite low.","[4, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

The largest fundamental issues of EOS IO have yet to be addressed and I think you've put a lot of hope into the Telos project fixing these massive short comings. Not to mention no ground breaking network features are coming from Block.one. I too would be burned out. It would be easy to feel like everything is one big pile of shit.

Optimistically, it will be zero within the next five years. I think it is is more likely that it will be slight above zero, but it will be lower than the taking reward... so the result in appreciation of total investment will be equivalent to negative issuance for those who are staking.

&gt; That's what the federal reserve says. 

The FED does not operate under a consensus mechanism. Their motivation is not the conservation of value of the underlying asset. They have asymmetric, incontestable control of issuance. Etheruem issuance is determined by consensus, which is entirely motivated by the conservation of value of the network, which in theory drives the price in the long run.

The best way to learn is to start researching from there. Learn about the ""eth killer"" blockchains like cardano, Tron, neo because they have better tech (for now) but less adoption. Learn about POW and POS coins, maybe some of the eth tokens that are really popular right now (beware scams). Diversify around classes of projects you think will be interesting or useful. Obviously you know BTC and it's usecase, so maybe checkout privacy coins (monero, dash, etc), smart contract coins (mentioned above), super scalable coins (ripple, nano, grin). 

From there you will probably see a lot of other coins mentioned so don't be afraid to check them out. In general stick to top 100 coins because after that it gets really sketchy. The most important thing is that a coin fulfills an actual need in the world. Many of the coins in the top 20 even are solutions looking for problems, or are redundant and questionably valued.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24]"

&gt; If a transaction is not confirmed for a long period of time, it will eventually be erased from a node’s mempool. The current default timeout is 72 hours but nodes may set their own duration. The transactions with the lowest value will also be dropped from the mempool, as higher fee transactions are entered and the mempool is limited in size.

* yeah. they took a 5 million doller grant from the ethereum foundation and used it to create their competitor scam chain.

* whilst all of that was secret, their dev in the ethereum ecosystem was the ""release manager"" for ethereum updates.

* mysteriously, several updates were cancelled and delayed during that time.

* the ethereum community found out what was happening and banished him for ever.

But, re: the Quadriga, it was never a 'good' exchange in the sense that it was always basically a Ponzi scheme, with a lot of shady doings being covered up by a combination of new deposits and steadily-rising prices through until 2018. Cotten didn't so much start becoming shady suddenly in 2018, as have a system that had been shady to some degree all along suddenly become unsustainable and come crashing down. It came as a surprise from the outside, but if he'd been regulated and audited, the issues would have been evident way earlier.

Something like Coinbase, which is regulated and audited, is a cut above that standard, and there are more such exchanges now than there used to be. Not to say that they can't still fail, but the odds of them failing under such 'unexpected' circumstances are low. 

All of which is just to say that OP should feel no fear in using a reputable, regulated exchange, certainly for short periods of time and even, assuming it's not crazy $$, for longer terms. People often get tied up in the principle of 'not your keys, not your coins', but the reality is that there are enough risks associated with self-storage (usually related to being an idiot with your info/security in some way) that it's not a black-and-white issue for most people.","[4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24]"

By using some of the most reputable exchanges, you'll minimize your risks.  Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and other big names should see the lowest risk of losing funds, and the less time that you have assets on the exchange, the less risk you face.

By that I mean that your biggest risk vectors are either 1) you do something stupid with your recovery seed, the risk of which is higher the more wallets, and therefore seeds, you have; or 2) someone sees you or connects your online identify to your real one and threatens you/your family with something unpleasant if you don't disclose your info, in which case multisig doesn't really help you (unless you use dummy accounts, but [you can do that with a single wallet](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-Advanced-Passphrase-options) anyway).

The real strength of multisig comes in situations where no single entity owns the assets in question--like an exchange wallet or a 'team' wallet shared among people for some other reason--and you don't want any single person being able to unilaterally do anything without the others' consent. When the assets are wholly owned by only one person, as seems to be the case here, the benefits of multisig become more 'niche', and the downsides begin to factor larger. For example, even if you aren't concerned about the above, [there are still downsides to multisig](https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/the-pitfalls-of-multisig-when-using-hardware-wallets-9b0e98e4c19c) that should be considered.

Personally, I think the most secure option for most users is a SINGLE hardware wallet, or a paper wallet if you don't need regular access. In either case, store the parts of the recovery seed in several, geographical separate places, and you're very, very safe. I think the potential benefits of multi-wallet and multi-sig options are balanced out by the increased risks in other areas, to say nothing of the additional costs and pain-in-the-ass of setting it all up and using it. However, if, despite all that, it still makes you feel better, there are resources out there (e.g., [here](https://medium.com/@tiero/how-to-bitcoin-multi-signature-wallet-using-electrum-and-several-ledger-nano-s-225867e3b726) and [here](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multisig.html)) for how to set this up.","[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"

But imagine if there were a form of digital gold that could be used as a trusted store of value and could be easily transported across borders and exchanged between anyone with internet and a smartphone. Wouldn't that be great? Of course, that kind of trust takes a long time to build up. Bitcoin is still a baby compared to gold in that regard, but that baby is growing up, and more and more people are waking up to its potential. I'm not saying that Bitcoin (or whatever other cryptocurrency someone may prefer) doesn't have its own limitations, because everything does, Bitcoin included. Currently, it's very volatile and yes, largely speculative.

Often when people first hear about cryptocurrency (usually Bitcoin initially as it's the most well known) they'll say: 

'What's the point of that? I can make payments easier using my bank, or Google pay, or Paypal!' 

My response would be that if you're living in a developed country with a stable currency and your government is not completely corrupt, you're *probably* fine with traditional banking. Not everyone is that lucky though. And who knows if you or me are always going to be that lucky? Bitcoin was created to take control of financial power away from banks and governments and put that power in the hands of the people. As long as you have a smartphone and internet connection, you're able to send and receive it, anywhere in the world! Hopefully in years to come more regular people, and especially the millions of unbanked, will become aware of this and be able to make use of this. It truly is revolutionary. Of course with that comes great personal responsibility. You're being your own bank here, so keep the keys to your crypto secure.

I started buying btc in 2016, and have been holding only btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years.

**Why use Digibyte's DigiAsset?**

The chain is active for last 8 years so it there for a very long time to prove that it is not some new hype project.

Digibyte's transaction fees are extremely cheap, and this utxo chain can handle the load of transactions from reddit community.

It takes 15 seconds between each blocktime, and the block size is capable of handling 1066 TPS and growing with time, as chan gets old till the last coin is mined.

Some things that you can do with digiasset tokens

**Fees**: Determines if there should be a fee when an Asset is transferred and what address should receive the fee, there could be multiple fee rules for one asset. One can think of this rule as facilitating Asset Affiliation.

If the Reddit community wants that a token is essential for voting but also want to keep the assets limited so they can set a fee that needs to be paid in the token the asset maker set, it can be the asset itself or some other token, so every time token is transfered the set address will recieve fee. This can help fund the community.

**Expiration**: Determines the lifespan of an Asset. When expiration time is reached the asset returns to the last valid Output with a valid expiration.

Lets say the community has decided to run give access to some special content for a time being, then asset expiration can be set after which they won't be able to use the asset to login or show that they have access to that content.

**Minter**: Addresses that are allowed to re-Issue an Asset, regardless of the [asset type](https://github.com/DigiByte-Core/DigiAssets-Protocol-Specifications/wiki/Benefits#coherent-issuance-policy).

So, if there are 4-5 mods who should have the capability to minting new assets you can allow them by adding their address to the asset and allowing them.

&amp;#x200B;

I started buying btc in 2016, and have been holding only btc since then. I continue to hold it, and even buy it, even though today my so called btc stash is 20x its original price.

Here is my general opinion about btc's price action in next 2-3 years

* first point, there will be no parabola like late 2017, where btc price went 4x in about 4 months. 4x price action in such short range, will not happen, Because there are many exchanges like bakkt and cme, which allow shorting of btc. Which means that price action will not be drastic.
* the upward movement in price will continue for next 2-3 yeras, and beyond. Overall, I expect it to be at 18k at EOY, and at about 25k-40k at end of 2021.
* The price rise is happening due to demand from gbtc ( normal 401-k holders), and demand from recent buyer like Microstrategy , which is a mnc that bought staggering 22k btc. That 22k btc, btw, took price from 9k to 11k. So here you can see demand directly taking price higher. I keep a tight watch on gbtc, and its accumulating btc at a drastic pace, spurred by demand from normal fellows mostly who are buying it for their 401-k. On top of that, get this, gbtc has **no redemption program**. Which means it only buys btc, ( and sells it only for fees if any).
* And now Fidelity is coming with its own Bitcoin Fund ( and only Bitcoin). That shows the demand for Bitcoin from the investors at large.
* Governments have already realized they cannot stop btc. Trump had told Mnuchin in 2018 to ""go after btc'. But mnuchin could not do anything, because there is not much he can do. So on that front, bitcoin has proven ( to the extent) its strength as decentralized network which can't be brought down easily be governments. That's why microstrategy bought it too - they aren't fools to put so much money in something Mnuchin could bring down overnight by a decree. So there will be no such decree.
* Another bullish point is ABSOLUTE lack of any alternative to btc. The top 10, apart from btc, is a shitshow. XRP is an out and out scam. and even others are totally no shots and scams. So Bitcoin is the only thing in this market.
* I think anyone who buys btc today, and holds for next 10 years, can get returns of about 10x-15x. And the thing is, the risk is very low, so I strongly recommend people to buy at least 10-20% of their portfolio in btc. This is for EVERYONE. I myself am about 80% into btc.
* Finally, don't buy btc if you can't stand falls as much as 75% ( in few months), and **more**. This is speculative asset. The base price is defined by long term holders, but the daily market price is defined by traders, who will sell all btc they hold ( even as people like me will not do that). So the price can flucuate, and I recommend you only buy if you can hold it for minimum 4 years.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24]"

AMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad). It is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.

It is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation. It also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page.

For individuals seeking an automated solution to this problem, they can try installing the Redirect AMP to HTML extension on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-amp-to-html/kifkmmpiicbcnkjaliilaoeaojlldonl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amp2html/?src=search).

However I don't think investor protection rules are that easily transferable to the crypto market. Applying the same transparency rules in the crypto markets would mean officially linking what’s supposed to be a decentralized asset to a centralized organisation (that doesn't even have an official connection to the asset as an issuer). That goes against a pretty fundamental ideal of cryptos. 

Also the IF doesn't directly rely on our investments. They were donated a significant amount that rises and falls with speculation, but it's not as if the fiat we use to buy IOTA goes straight into their pocket like with IPO's. That may sound nitpicky, as market trust and sentiment obviously affect their bottom line immensely, but the legal connection isn't (and arguably shouldn't be) there.

Going back to my comparison to gold; mining companies aren't beholden to the people that speculate on the price of gold, even if they stand to gain from that speculation, because there's no legal connection between the two and no basis for one. 

You've actually given me a pretty solid idea for a thesis; this is obviously a relevant and pretty complicated question.","[3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"

For supply chain, Walmart would be better off to use their own chain run on their own servers. Attackers? It has no monetary value. Trusted vs trustless? Walmart already trusts itself.

For large corporations, there are no advantages to basing their supply chain management on a publicly traded chain. A private chain on an intranet (non-public large network) has zero value to attackers whereas a publicly traded chain incentivizes exploiters.

Suppose that JPM did have some kind of payment token for their private blockchain, call it jpmETH.  It would presumably be used to pay for computation on the private eth-like chain that jpm runs which would presumably mean financial transactions etc.

Now, how does this differ from just paying JPM for those services as your bank/broker or whatever?  If JPM were then to share that blockchain with competitors so that you can use jpmETH to purchase financial services of other firms (say, idk, Schwab), then how is any of this different from how the same firms could partner with each other on a subscription model without any blockchains involved?

If the existence of this subscription model possibility does not threaten Ethereum, then neither does a private chain model.  After all, a private chain is just an immutable database.  Not saying there won't be private chains, just that they have a different use case entirely and there is no reason that they even need a monetary token.

EDIT: They don't need a monetary token because the company could just charge subscription fees for using their private chain.","[4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23]"

I agree that price action was baked in on the BTC side from larger investors, but also keep in mind that BTC crashed alongside with the market albeit its recovery was a couple of days after the sp500 bottomed out. Although, if we want to be fair, the Nasdaq is a better market to compare BTC to since it's a growth index that's tech-driven and arguably has a similar demographic of investors. When looking at the Nasdaq, BTC's bottom was printed about 10 days prior to the Nasdaq bottom, but Nasdaq broke its Feb high about a month sooner and with more conviction that BTC did. As with gold, the price rebounded even quicker than the Nasdaq and has appreciated roughly about the same as BTC in the same timeframe post-crash.
2. Definitely agree, still early days or maybe BTC's days are numbered, we won't know until the dust clears. The Dotcom crash was supposed to be the end of a lot of companies, but instead they came back even stronger and are not at the forefront.

1) most price action is already baked in by the larger institutional investors (as it also was in the broader stock market). We did trend downward, which was not ideal, but gold was also negatively impacted by today’s news

2) retail traders and existing whales are still the primary drivers of the BTCs price. While institutions are slowly on boarding, they are in more of a hold-and-see approach as opposed to active day trading

3) lastly, BTC gonna do whatever BTC wants to do. I know that’s a pretty lame response, but I still believe BTC is in a “gray” zone and hasn’t fully decoupled or coupled to any correlation other than stock to flow.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24]"

Everyone thinks printer goes brrrr and we automatically get Inflation. That's not how it works. The Fed can make a big show about capitalizing banks balance sheets but that means jack shit if they don't actually start lending or people start borrowing money. They aren't and were not, 80% of stimulus money is sitting untouched as depository reserves. 

They tried to reach the 2% inflation target for an entire decade post 2008 they hit it once briefly, that was before the economy was cut in half.

The far more likely scenario is deflation from 2 decades of expansive monetary policy. In the 80's we had a limited monetary base with the gold standard an excessive velocity creating inflation. The fix was raise fed rate to 20% cutting off commercial banks, lower lending standards and make credit easier to get making them lend. Expand the monetary base with credit expansion, This actually worked back then. 

Now we have the opposite problem today we have a uncontrollable massively huge monetary base from 40 years of credit expansion. We have the highest unemployment in history, lowest consumer demand, lowest monetary velocity, lowest demand for new debt. All points to deflation not inflation. 

Then why did we get this little pop of inflation since March. #1 people frantically selling their dollars fearing inflation that's not there and #2 the pause of all debt in forebearance since March.

A rapidly appreciating dollar from a deflationary spiral is a real threat to crypto, metals, and equities.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24]"

As I mentioned before I worked for a company with whom I patented an idea. This idea was already in use by their customers! So how was the patent granted? Because patent reviewers don’t know enough about specific topics and/or don’t have access to relevant details. Because patents are deliberately written vaguely to try and expand their scope, while occasionally mentioning something specific so they don’t get rejected as too vague by those reviewers who don’t know enough to tell said specific mention is even remotely relevant. So they mentioned some specific stuff - a little bit like this one does with iota - and it was almost pot luck what they (we - I wrote it!) chose given we just had to say something specific and as long as it covered enough use cases then, who cares?! So even specific mentions don’t mean a lot except - optimistically - that that mention covers the most potential use cases the patent could cover. Even though literally it is **never** going to be utilised. 

Furthermore, but patents can’t be defended if the idea was already around! I hear you cry. No they can’t, but it still takes a lot of money to defend that and many companies can’t afford or have the will to do it. Which is why patents benefit large corporations so disproportionately. And that’s why large corporations can abuse them so easily as few people can afford to challenge and then spending $1000/y/patent or whatever is peanuts to them.

Furthrfurthermore, the reason for the patent wasn’t to stop them doing what they were already doing, it was to stop them doing a very slight variation which would have stopped my company getting as much profit from the current set-up. But, and here’s the really important point you don’t get, my company didn’t think for a second that the customers would do that because there’s various reasons why it wouldn’t be so good for them overall. But my company did the patent *anyway*. Why? “Just in case” and because “patents cost peanuts” to large corporations relative to the revenue they make. Plus there’s tax deductions for work classified as R&amp;D which makes patent - even ones that contain no actual work (but who the fuck knows?) - near free to these corporations if they can tax deduct them for at least some of their existence. So they did a “no brainier” because the relative cost to do it was so much lower than what they *might* lose, even though they thought there was basically no chance of that ever happening. So not only was the patent **never** going to be used, they didn’t expect anyone to **ever** breach it. 

And that’s one example of the types of perverse reasons that corporations make patents. So, I say again, the patent system is broken and large corporations making patents is essentially meaningless. Whether you want to accept that or not. 

This is why patent trolls exist because corporations are doing this **all the time**. Patent trolls literally couldn’t exist if it wasn’t for these constant pointless patents. I repeat, the information patents given about a company’s intention to exploit it, or expectation that anyone else will, is extremely minimal. That’s it.","[4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24]"

I have micro-inverters on my rooftop system but thats because of some partial shading and different orientations.  Never had any fail in 5 years though so not sure if he bought some cheap ones.

His south-facing hill is a great location, also being high is great as its cooler and there is less atmosphere so he will get more solar output.

The biggest single attribute that makes this workable for mining is net metering though, that is a killer deal and it means his overnight energy cost is offest by his daytime generation.

Hope he is claiming his SolarCoin (SLR)!","[0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19, 23]"
